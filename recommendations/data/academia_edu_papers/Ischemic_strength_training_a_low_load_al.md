Strength training with low loads in combination with vascular occlusion has been proposed as an alternative to heavy resistance exercise in the rehabilitation setting, especially when high forces acting upon the musculo-skeletal system are contraindicated. Several studies on low-to-moderate in tensity resistance exercise combined with cuﬀocclusion have demonstrated increases in muscle strength and size that are comparable to those typically seen after conventional high load strength training. However, the physiological mechan isms by which occlusion training induces increased muscle mass and strength are currently unclear, although several

candidate stimuli have been proposed. Also, the long-term safety, practicality, and eﬃcacy of this training method are still controversial. Furthermore, recent studies have demon strated that in some instances, tourniquet cuﬀs may not be necessary for relative ischemia and signiﬁcant training eﬀects to occur with resistance exercise at low-to-moderate loads.The aims of the present review are to summarize current opinion and knowledge regarding the physiology of ischemic strength training and to discuss some of the training and health aspects of this type of exercise. In addition, suggestions for further research are given.

Strength training is an important component of training in most sports as well as in the area of injury prevention and rehabilitation (Escamilla & Wick ham, 2003). In the prescription of resistance exercise,training intensity or the load used is commonly regarded as the most important variable (Fleck &Kraemer, 1997). The intensity in dynamic resistance training is often quantiﬁed as a function of the maximum weight that can be lifted only once (one repetition maximum, 1RM). Most authors agree that the load should be at least 60% of 1RM in order to stimulate increases in strength and that optimal strength gains results from loads in excess of 80%of 1RM (Atha, 1981; Ha kkinen, 1994; Fleck &Kraemer, 1997; ACSM, 2002; Andersen et al.,2006). For muscle hypertrophy, loads of 6–12RM are usually recommended, corresponding to  70–85% of 1RM (Ha kkinen, 1994; Fleck & Kraemer,1997; ACSM, 2002).

In the clinical setting, however, it is often diﬃcult and sometimes also contraindicated to use near maximal loads (e.g., early rehabilitation after a sports injury). Muscle atrophy and weakness often occur rapidly in the aﬀected area due to the eﬀects of trauma (or disease) and inactivity. Consequently,

training modalities that promote hypertrophy or counteract atrophy without the use of heavy loads should be of special interest in the rehabilitation of injuries and some chronic diseases for which high musculo-skeletal forces are contraindicated.

In the mid-1990s, Rooney et al. (1994) and Schott et al. (1995) suggested that fatigue and metabolite accumulation were important factors in the resis tance exercise stimulus leading to increased strength and accretion of muscle mass. These ﬁndings were extended by Shinohara et al. (1998) and Takarada et al. (2000b), who used tourniquet cuﬀs to partially restrict the muscle blood ﬂow during training with low resistance in order to cause increases in muscle strength. In these and in several subsequent studies (Takarada et al., 2002, 2004; Burgomaster et al.,2003; Abe et al., 2005a, b; Kubo et al., 2006), low to-moderate intensity (20–50% of 1RM) resistance training with vascular occlusion has been shown to lead to gains in muscle strength and volume comparable to those seen after conventional heavy resistance training. In one recent study, hypertrophy of the quadriceps was even observed after walk training with tourniquets (Abe et al., 2006). It has also been reported that brief intermittent tourniquet-

induced ischemia-reperfusion, without exercise, can decrease disuse atrophy; at least in some muscles (Takarada et al., 2000c; Clark et al., 2006; Kubota et al., 2008).

The combination of low loads and large training eﬀects suggests that ischemic strength training may be a useful method in rehabilitation and other con texts. However, the practicality and the safety of training with vascular occlusion remain controver sial. Therefore, the purpose of the present review is to summarize current opinion and knowledge regarding the physiology of ischemic strength training and to discuss some of the training and health aspects of this type of exercise.

## Physiology

## Motor unit recruitment

It is generally believed that only muscle ﬁbers that are activated during exercise grow as a result of strength training (Kraemer et al., 1996). The size principle of motor unit recruitment dictates that small units composed of slow but fatigue resistant ﬁbers are recruited ﬁrst and with increasing demands for force or power, increasingly larger units are recruited (Henneman et al., 1965). Studies using glycogen depletion (Gollnick et al., 1974a, b; Vølles tad et al., 1984; Vøllestad & Blom, 1985) and altera tions in phosphocreatine-to-creatine ratios in muscle ﬁbers (Beltman et al., 2004a, b) have supported the notion that the size principle is operating in humans during exercise. Thus, units with type I ﬁbers are usually recruited ﬁrst and with increasing intensity of exercise, units comprised of type IIa ﬁbers and ﬁnally also units with type IIx ﬁbers are recruited (Beltman et al., 2004a). In relatively large limb muscles such as the deltoid and the biceps brachii, recruitment of new motor units with increasing loads occurs up to at least 85% of maximum voluntary isometric action (MVIA) (Duchateau et al., 2006). Thus, it would appear that the heavy loads typically used in resis tance training regimes are required to ensure that most motor units are recruited and thus exposed to the stimulus of strength training.

However, numerous studies (e.g., Vøllestad et al.,1984; Sahlin et al., 1997; Houtman et al., 2002, 2003)have shown that the recruitment thresholds for the motor units decrease during fatiguing exercise at submaximal loads so that type II ﬁbers are increas ingly recruited as the point of torque failure draws closer. Restricting the muscle blood ﬂow with a tourniquet has been shown to decrease the endurance and increase the electrical activity (as measured by electromyography, EMG) of the working muscle during low-intensity exercise. For example, Takarada et al. (2000b) showed that the EMG of the biceps brachii during low-intensity resistance exercise (40%

of 1RM) combined with partial occlusion of the muscle blood ﬂow was almost equal to that observed during conventional heavy resistance exercise (80%of 1RM). In an early study on low-intensity dynamic knee extensions performed to exhaustion during cuﬀocclusion, Ingemann-Hansen et al. (1981) observed glycogen depletion in both ﬁber types as well as low creatine phosphate levels in muscle biopsies taken immediately post exercise before the release of the occlusion. Yasuda et al. (2005) reported type II ﬁber hypertrophy as well as increased whole muscle cross sectional area (CSA) after a period of low-intensity strength training (20% of 1RM) combined with vascularocclusion.Collectively,theseﬁndings strongly suggest that type II ﬁbers are recruited also during very low-intensity ischemic training.Indeed, it has been argued that the enhanced hyper trophic response to exercise with blood ﬂow restric tion may simply be due to the recruitment of large motor units and the resulting mechanical load on the muscle ﬁbers in these units (Meyer, 2006).

## Response of hormones and systemic growth factors

Heavy-resistance exercise can result in acute changes in the plasma levels of several hormones and growth factors. While some studies have also demonstrated changes in the resting levels of some hormones after short-term training, it has been argued that the acute hormonal response is of greater importance for hypertrophicadaptationsthanchronicchanges (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005). Hormones and sys temic growth factors that have been shown to in crease acutely in plasma as a result of a strength training bout include growth hormone (GH), testos terone, cortisol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),insulin, and catecholamines (Kraemer & Ratamess,2005). To date, most of the research has been focused on the anabolic hormones GH and testosterone, and the catabolic hormone cortisol.

With low-load occlusion training, very large acute increases in plasma GH have been demonstrated in some studies (Takarada et al., 2000a, 2004), which led these authors to speculate that GH may play a part in the muscle hypertrophy seen after this type of training. However, the evidence for a role for GH in exercise-inducedmusclehypertrophyislimited.McCall et al. (1999) reported signiﬁcant correlations between the acute increases in GH and the increases in type I and type II ﬁber area in the biceps brachii in response to a period of strength training, but there was no relationship between increases in GH and increases in whole muscle area for the biceps brachii.Goto et al. (2005) reported signiﬁcant correlations between acute exercise-induced elevations in GH and increases in quadriceps CSA after a training period.While the correlations reported in the studies of

McCall et al. (1999) and Goto et al. (2005) appear to support a role for GH, they do not prove causality. It is possible that the increased levels of GH reﬂected a greater level of eﬀort, which in itself would likely be suﬃcient to cause increased growth. Additionally,elevated levels of GH may be caused by and/or occur in parallel to local processes which may be more important for the hypertrophic response. Further more, studies examining exogenous GH in combina tion with resistance exercise have generally not shown any signiﬁcant additive eﬀects on muscle anabolism (reviewed by Rennie, 2003). However, it should also be noted that there are several variants of GH as well as other peptides that are released from the pituitary gland in response to resistance training (Hymer et al., 2006). Thus, the physiological signiﬁcance of the GH response to both conventional and ischemic strength training is currently unclear.

Many of the eﬀects of GH are mediated by IGF-1.Originally, IGF-1 was regarded as a systemic growth factor produced by the liver under the inﬂuence of GH. During the last decades, it has become evident that GH also stimulates local IGF-1 production in the peripheral tissues, including muscle, and that GH itself has direct eﬀects on local tissues (Goldspink et al., 2006). The acute response of circulating IGF-1to resistance exercise is unclear (Kraemer & Rata mess, 2005). In a recent study by Popov et al. (2006),a moderate-intensity (50% of 1RM) leg press regime with no relaxation between repetitions and short inter-set rest periods (30 s) induced an acute increase in circulating IGF-1 levels, which was highly corre lated with the increase in plasma GH. As will be discussed in a later section, this type of regime has many similarities with training combined with cuﬀocclusion.

However, it seems unlikely that an acute increase in GH could cause such immediate increases in circulating IGF-1, because the response of IGF-1to GH pulses is delayed (3–9 h) and peak values of IGF-1 may not be reached until after 16–28 h post exercise (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2005). In a study by Goto et al. (2003a), the elevated GH levels after a combination of high and moderate-intensity resis tance training were correlated with the acute in creases in thigh circumference. The acute increase in muscle CSA immediately post exercise is in turn correlated with a decrease in plasma volume (Ploutz Snyder et al., 1995). Plasma volume decreases of 20–22% have been noted after leg press and barbell squat exercises (Ploutz et al., 1993; Ploutz-Snyder et al., 1995). Therefore, the increase in IGF-1 in the study of Popov et al. (2006) may have been caused by hemoconcentration.

Furthermore, the correlation between the acute increases in GH and IGF-1 reported in the study of Popov et al. (2006) may be spurious, because of the

relationship between acute muscle volume changes and GH. The ﬂuid shifts in resistance exercise from the circulation into the active muscles are thought to be caused largely by accumulation of lactate, hydro gen ions, sodium ions, and phosphate in the working muscles (Ploutz-Snyder et al., 1995). These metabo lites and ions have also been implicated as important in the GH response to exercise, presumably through metaboreceptors in the muscles that sense changes in concentrations and provide feedback to the central nervous system (Gordon et al., 1994; Viru et al.,1998). Thus, fatiguing low-to-moderate intensity strength training during ischemic conditions leads to accumulation of metabolites and ions in the working muscles, which in turn leads to both an increase in GH secretion (through feedback from muscle metaboreceptors) and increased plasma levels ofIGF-1(mainlythroughhemoconcentration).Nevertheless, hemoconcentration of hormones and growth factors may be of physiological signiﬁcance as increased blood concentration of these molecules,regardless of mechanism, means a greater probability of interactions with receptors (Kraemer & Ratamess,2005).

Regarding longer term changes in resistance train ing with vascular occlusion, signiﬁcant increases in circulating levels of IGF-1 along with gains in muscle volume were reported in one study (Abe et al.,2005a). However, it has been suggested that systemic factors may be of secondary importance in muscle hypertrophy in comparison to the ‘‘local’’ system of muscle adaptation (Adams, 2002; Walker et al., 2004;Eliakim et al., 2006; Goldspink et al., 2006). Still, this does not exclude the possibility that systemic factors mayamplifythehypertrophyinducedbythe localizedtraining,asproposedbyViruand Viru (2000). Indeed, a recent study on strength training with blood ﬂow restriction (Madarame et al., 2008) provided evidence for a potentiating eﬀect of systemic factors. In this study, performing addi tional leg exercise with vascular occlusion after arm training resulted in greater increases in both muscle area and isometric strength for the elbow ﬂexors compared with an identical arm training regime sup plemented with leg exercise without occlusion.

It is uncertain which factor(s) that could mediate this potentiating eﬀect. In their paper, Madarame et al. (2008) suggested that noradrenaline was respon sible for the enhanced hypertrophy, based on the diﬀerences in the acute response between the two regimes, while GH and testosterone did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly.Theyalsoremarkedthatseveral b-adrenergic agonists have anabolic eﬀects on skele tal muscle. However, a causative role for catechola mines was not proven in their study. It should also be noted that the increase in GH was signiﬁcant for the occluded regime, while the response for the

non-occluded regime was not. Hence, a role for GH,either on its own or synergistically with the catecho lamine response, cannot be ruled out at present.

However, numerous studies have demonstrated marked hypertrophy in response to localized training regimes (for a review, see Wernbom et al., 2007), and Walker et al. (2004) reported equal gains in strength and muscle area in response to arm training only vs combined arm and whole-body training. From their description, it appears that the arm training routine in the study of Madarame et al. (2008) was submax imal in terms of the eﬀort required, and the  3–4%increase (not signiﬁcant) in muscle area in the trained arm in the non-occluded group compared with the  11–12% increase in the occluded group suggests that it was largely unsuccessful in itself. Therefore, it is presently unclear whether an additive eﬀect of an enhanced systemic response would occur in the presence of a more eﬀective local training stimulus.Furthermore, while the amplifying eﬀect was present in the trained arm, the untrained arm did not increase in muscle area (  1%). Thus, as the authors themselves noted, a local exercise stimulus is indis pensible for muscle hypertrophy.

## Local growth factors and intracellular signaling pathways

It is generally held that signiﬁcant hypertrophy is seen only in the exercised muscle and not in the other muscles in the body (Adams, 2002; Goldspink et al.,2006). Several mechanisms intrinsic to the muscle are involved in the localized hypertrophic response to resistancetraining,includingautocrine/paracrine growth factors, intracellular signaling induced by changes in the local environment (e.g., transduction of mechanical tension into intracellular signals), and changes in the content of receptors of hormones and growth factors.

IGF-1 is expressed in skeletal muscle in addition to being present in the circulation, which means that it can also act as a local growth factor. Changing the availability of the muscle growth factors IGF-1 and mechano-growth factor (MGF, a splice variant of IGF-1) and myostatin appears to be a central reg ulatory process in adaptive skeletal muscle growth (Rennie et al., 2004). Localized infusion of IGF-1 or MGF as well as genetic overexpression of IGF-1 has been shown to increase muscle mass (reviewed by Goldspink et al., 2006) and increases in IGF-1variants in skeletal muscle have been demonstrated in several animal and human models of functional overload, including resistance exercise (reviewed by Rennie et al., 2004; Glass, 2005; Tidball, 2005).Hypertrophic intracellular signaling downstream of IGF-1 include the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammaliantargetofrapamycin (mTOR) and the PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase

3 b (GSK3b) pathways (Rennie et al., 2004; Glass,2005; Tidball, 2005). Akt is also known as protein kinase B (PKB). The downstream targets of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are the translational reg ulators p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) and eukaryotic in itiation factor-4E-binding protein (4E-BP) (Adams,2002; Rennie et al., 2004; Glass, 2005). Downstream in the PI3K/Akt/GSK3b pathway is the eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B). The end results of activation of these pathways are increases in protein synthesis and cell growth (Bolster et al., 2004; Glass,2005; Baar et al., 2006).

Contrary to the anabolic eﬀects of IGF-1/MGF on skeletal muscle, myostatin acts as a negative regula tor of skeletal muscle growth (Roth & Walsh, 2004).Increases in IGF-1/MGF have been observed after acute bouts and longer term strength training (re viewed by Goldspink et al., 2006, see also Kim et al.,2005; Petrella et al., 2006). Reductions in myostatin have been noted in several (Roth et al., 2003; Walker et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2005; Petrella et al., 2006;Raue et al., 2006; Hulmi et al., 2007) but not all (e.g.,Willoughby, 2004) studies on the myostatin response to strength training. Based on these observations, it has been hypothesized that the up-regulation of IGF-1/MGF and the downregulation of myostatin are neces sary for an optimal hypertrophic response (Kim et al.,2005).

Regarding any possible eﬀects of occlusion train ing on local IGF-1/MGF in humans, there are at present no data available. There are also currently no reports concerning changes in myostatin in humans in conjunction with ischemic strength training. In a rat model of partial vascular occlusion, myostatin levels were shown to decrease along with increases in muscle weight and myoﬁber areas (Kawada & Ishii,2005). Interestingly, no signiﬁcant increase in the expression of IGF-1 was seen in this model. How ever, it should be noted that the model used by Kawada and Ishii (2005) involved chronic restriction of blood ﬂow, as opposed to the intermittent occlu sion models used in human studies and that this diﬀerence may result in substantially diﬀerent adap tations.

The tension developed by the muscle appears to be a critical stimulus for the hypertrophy associated with strength training. Apart from acting via the induction of local growth factors such as IGF-1/MGF, it is becoming increasingly evident that me chanical tension can directly activate anabolic signal ing pathways (reviewed by Vandenburgh, 1992;Hornberger & Esser, 2004; Huijing & Jaspers,2005). It has been noted that the earliest activation of hypertrophic signaling after resistance exercise is too rapid to be accounted for by growth factors.Consequently, the involvement of mechanochemical transduction, and/or other processes such as calcium

release, have been suggested in this early response,which is followed by a late response presumably involvinggrowthfactorssuchasIGF-1/MGF (Wackerhage & Rennie, 2003). Recently, it was ob served that a functional IGF-1 receptor is not neces sary for overload-induced muscle hypertrophy in rats (Spangenburg et al., 2008); a ﬁnding which strength ens the case for the importance of direct mechano transduction. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the possible mechanisms by which tension is transduced into intracellular signals; the interested reader is referred to the reviews above and to recent original papers (Boppart et al., 2006; Hornberger et al., 2006; Spangenburg & McBride, 2006). Inter estingly, there appears to be some overlap between the pathways activated by mechanical stimuli and those activated by growth factors (Tidball, 2005).

In a recent study (Fujita et al., 2007), an acute bout of low-intensity (20% of 1RM) resistance training combined with vascular occlusion increased muscle protein synthesis, along with an increase in the phophorylation of p70S6K and a decreased phos phorylationofeukaryoticelongationfactor2(eEF2). These authors concluded that hormonal changes, metabolic stress, and/or mechanotransduc tion signaling might have been involved in the mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Because post exercise biopsies were obtained only at a time point of 3 h after exercise, and no data on growth factor re sponses were reported, it is diﬃcult to assess the relative contributions of growth factors vs mechan otransduction and/or other early events, including systemic responses, with this type of training.

## Other exercise-related factors

Apart from hormones, growth factors and mechan ical stimuli, a wealth of other factors in the environ ment of the muscle also aﬀect intracellular signaling.Changes in blood ﬂow (Kraemer & Ratamess, 2004),heat stress (Goto et al., 2003), reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Takarada et al., 2000a), hypoxia–hyperoxia (Kawada, 2005), and nitric oxide (NO) (Kawada &Ishii, 2005) have all been suggested as possible stimuli in training with vascular occlusion.

Blocking endogenous NO production decreases the hypertrophic response by 50% in animal models of functional overload (Smith et al., 2002;Sellman et al., 2006). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that satellite cells can be activated in response to mechanical stretch by the release of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in a NO-dependent manner (Tatsumi et al., 2006). In addition, NO is involved in other mechanotransduction processes such as integrin signaling (Zhang et al., 2007). The isoforms of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are activated

by numerous stimuli, including exercise and possibly also hypoxia (Stamler & Meissner, 2001).

In their study on a rat model of chronic partial occlusion, Kawada and Ishii (2005) reported in creased levels of NOS-1 mRNA along with the increase in muscle weight. However, changes in other possible regulators of muscle mass were also present,such as a decrease in myostatin and an increase in heat shock protein 72 (HSP-72). Little is currently known regarding the possible roles of NO in muscle hypertrophy in human models of resistance training,including ischemic strength training.

It has been suggested that NO regulates the ex pression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) in skeletal mucle (Soltow et al., 2006). The COX enzymes catalyzes the production of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid that is released from membrane phospholipids by the enzyme phospholipase $A _ { 2 }$(Bos et al., 2004; Shen et al., 2006). Prostaglandins of the COX-2 pathway include prostaglandin $E _ { 2 }$ $F _ { 2 }$ a$( P G F _ { 2 a } )$. These (PGE2) and prostaglandin were implicated in mechanotransduction and the control of protein synthesis and degradation already in the early 1980s (for a review see Thompson &Palmer, 1998). Blocking the production of these prostaglandins blunts the increased protein synthesis after an acute bout of heavy eccentric exercise (Trappe et al., 2001, 2002). Furthermore, recent data suggest that the COX-2 pathway is important for myonuclear addition in vivo and satellite cell activation and proliferation in vitro (Bondesen et al., 2006), and PG$F _ { 2 x }$ may regulate hypertrophy of skeletal muscle by activating both cell fusion and protein synthesis (Horsley & Pavlath, 2003).

To date, no training study in humans has been published which has conﬁrmed the role of prosta glandins in skeletal muscle hypertrophy, but experi ments with rodent models have demonstrated the importance of the COX-2 pathway in recovery from atrophy (Bondesen et al., 2006) and for hypertrophy resulting from functional overload (Soltow et al.,2006). Also, a recent human study has shown in creased levels of PG$F _ { 2 a }$after conventional resistance exercise (Trappe et al., 2006).

Whether prostaglandins are produced in humans also in response to low-load training with vascular occlusion is currently not known. However, in creased muscle levels of arachidonic acid and pros taglandins have been noted in studies on cats subjected to electrically induced isometric exercise and ischemia, and greater increases were seen after a combination than after either intervention alone (Rotto et al., 1989; Symons et al., 1991). Moreover,prostaglandins are involved in the sensitization and stimulation of group III and IV muscle aﬀerents, and the responses of these aﬀerents are increased during dynamic exercise with occlusion compared with

freely perfused conditions (Hayes et al., 2006).Group IV thin ﬁbers represent the aﬀerent pathway from metaboreceptors and may mediate the GH response during muscle activity (Viru et al., 1998).On the basis of these observations, we suggest that the potential role of prostaglandins in ischemic strength training should be investigated.

Regarding the potential role of ROS in muscle hypertrophy, several interesting observations have been made in both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. ROS have been implicated in cardiac hyper trophy; an eﬀect which may be mediated via phos phatidic acid, which in turn is regulated by the enzyme phospholipase D (Tappia et al., 2006). In skeletal muscle, recent evidence strongly suggests a role for phospholipase D activation and subsequent production of phosphatidic acid in mTOR signaling in response to mechanical stimulation (Hornberger et al., 2006). In cardiac muscle, activation of phospho lipase D is seen in the early part of the reperfusion after ischemia, whereas following prolonged reperfu sion, a reduced activity is seen instead (Tappia et al.,2006). These authors speculated that low levels and brief exposures to ROS may stimulate phospholipase D-mediated signal transduction, whereas prolonged exposure and high levels of ROS result in phospho lipase D inhibition. In line with these observations,low levels of hydrogen peroxide ($H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 } )$ induces hypertrophy in cardiac myocytes, whereas higher concentrations result in apoptosis (Kwon et al.,2003).

Concerning skeletal muscle, growing evidence sup ports a role for ROS in muscle atrophy (reviewed by Powers et al., 2007), but again, this can possibly be explained by the negative eﬀects of prolonged ex posures and high levels of ROS, as opposed to brief exposures to low concentrations of ROS. Further more,$H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$induces activation of p70S6K in diﬀerent cell types (Bae et al., 1999; Tu et al., 2002), and it has been suggested that $H _ { 2 } O _ { 2 }$acts as a second messenger in growth factor-induced p70S6K signaling (Bae et al., 1999). Given these ﬁndings, we suggest further studies on the possible involvement of ROS in mediating some of the hypertrophic adaptations to strength training during the ischemic conditions.

As argued by Widegren et al. (2001), it is unlikely that exercise responses are caused by one single mechanism and more likely that they depend on the integration of multiple local and systemic factors. As is obvious from the above discussion, numerous mechanisms may contribute to the hypertrophic eﬀects seen after ischemic strength training. Current evidence suggests that the high degree of motor unit recruitment is a major factor, and there is also some data indicating that the systemic response may en hance the eﬀects of the mechanical tension during certaincircumstances(e.g.,atlow-to-moderate

loads). The evidence for additive and/or independent eﬀects of ischemia–reperfusion in the training situa tion, although an attractive hypothesis, is limited.Further investigations are obviously needed to study both the impact of individual factors and the inter play between them.

## Practical and health aspects

### Is occlusion training safe and feasible?

As discussed by Takarada et al. (2000b), training with cuﬀocclusion may have the potential to create muscle damage and other serious side eﬀects such as thrombosis and damage to blood vessels. Further more, high levels of ROS are linked to proteolysis and apoptosis (Powers et al., 2007). However, in another study by Takarada et al. (2000a), no evi dence of muscle damage or high levels of oxidative stress were found as judged by the low levels of creatine kinase and lipid peroxide after their proto col. Although measurements of ﬁber areas have been included in a few studies (Ohta et al., 2003; Yasuda et al., 2005), little is currently known about the eﬀects of occlusion training on soft tissues beneath and distal to the tourniquet, including markers of pro teolysis, apoptosis, and necrosis.

In our literature search, we found 13 training studies (see Table 1 for references) using blood ﬂow restriction with a tourniquet. These studies on occlu sion training have typically lasted between 2 and 8weeks, but two studies (Takarada et al., 2000b; Ohta et al., 2003) lasted for 16 weeks. In these 13 studies, a total of 116 subjects trained a total of 4376 training sessions. In most of them, the occlusion was partial and the duration of occlusion generally lasted be tween 5 and 10 min and except for acute muscle pain,no adverse eﬀects were reported. In a study by Kilian et al. (2005), 10 min of complete occlusion of the forearm resulted in no measurable eﬀects on leuko cyte and platelet activation and even 20 min of ischemia failed to result in measureable changes.Although some endothelial dysfunction was noted with especially the longer duration, this was essen tially recovered within 60 min.

Recently, Nakajima et al. (2006) published a survey on the safety of occlusion training based on reports from 105 training centers in Japan, where this method, also termed ‘‘Kaatsu training’’, has become widely popular for both ﬁtness and rehabilitation purposes. A total of over 12 600 individuals had trained using tourniquets in combination with diﬀer ent modes of exercise (walking, cycling, weight train ing, etc.). The most common side eﬀects were subcutaneous hemorrhage (incidence: 13.1%) and temporary numbness (1.3%). More serious side ef fects were rare: venous thrombosis (0.055%), dete rioration of ischemic heart disease (0.016%), cerebral

The studies of Ohta et al. (2003), Ishii et al. (2005) and Teramoto and Golding (2006) are not included in this table, because it was not possible to quantify the exercise intensities in relative terms from the descriptions of their training programs. The study of Yasuda et al. (2005) was based on subjects from the study of Abe et al. (2005a) and is therefore not included in this table.

infarction (0.008%), rhabdomyolysis (0.008%), and pulmonary embolism (0.008%). It should be noted that this report was published by the same research group that has conducted most of the studies on this type of training. In summary, although current evidence suggests it may be a relatively safe mode of training in the short term, more research is needed regarding potential adverse eﬀects and how these can be minimized.

Apart from safety issues, the muscle pain experi enced during ischemic strength training can be in tense, and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) is not uncommon (Wernbom et al., 2006). The DOMS subsides after a few workouts, suggesting a repeated bout eﬀect, and it also appears that if the initial volume is low (e.g., 1–2 sets), much of the DOMS can be avoided (unpublished observations). Still, training combined with ischemia clearly requires a high degree of motivation from the trainee, especially if performed with a high level of eﬀort.

### Narrow or wide tourniquets?

A question which is of both practical and physiolo gical relevance for training with pressure cuﬀs is the width of the tourniquet. In the context of limb surgery, it has been recommended that wide tourni quets should be used, as wide cuﬀs have been shown to achieve occlusion at considerably lower pressures than more narrow cuﬀs (Crenshaw et al., 1988;Graham et al., 1993). With wide tourniquets and lower pressures, the deleterious eﬀects of high com pression and shear forces on soft tissues may be reduced (Crenshaw et al., 1988; Graham et al., 1993).

In most of the training studies published up to date, narrow cuﬀs have been used at pressures of between 160 and 240 mmHg. Takano et al. (2005)used a pressure of 160–180 mmHg in combination with a 33 mm pressure belt and showed a reduction in femoral blood ﬂow to about 30% of normal resting conditions, before exercise. Immediately after exer cise, the blood ﬂow was still markedly reduced to about 50% of that measured during rest. With a 140mm-wide cuﬀ, Laurentino et al. (2008) reported cessationofthetibialarterypulse(measured with Doppler) at pressures of  130 mmHg. Using a 135-mm-wide curved tourniquet with a 100 mm wide-pneumatic bag inside it, we have found that pressures of  90–110 mmHg are usually suﬃcient to partially restrict blood ﬂow and aﬀect muscle endurance (unpublished observations). Thus, it ap pears that high pressures during training are not necessary with wide tourniquets and should probably be avoided because of potential risks with the com bination of severe occlusion and a high degree of compression.

An obvious drawback with wide pressure cuﬀs is that they may interfere with the exercise, but this is probably more signiﬁcant when training the upper limb than the lower limb. However, the upper limb requires less pressure to achieve occlusion and there fore the tourniquets can be somewhat narrower.Even so, relatively wide cuﬀs of 70–90 mm in width and relatively low pressures (100 mmHg) have been applied in some experiments on occlusion training for the elbow ﬂexors (Takarada et al., 2000b; Moore et al., 2004). Another potential drawback with wide cuﬀs is that more tissue gets compressed, but this is likely more than outweighed by the reduction in shear forces and pressure gradients. Also, the inter individual variability in the pressure needed to achieve complete occlusion is considerably smaller with wide cuﬀs because the occlusion eﬀect with these is much less dependent on the circumference of the limb (Crenshaw et al., 1988). Translated to the training situation, this should make it easier to ﬁnd a proper pressure to achieve a partial occlusion.Taken together, it appears that relatively wide cuﬀs are preferable to narrow cuﬀs.

Are tourniquets necessary to induce relative ischemia with low-load training?

Studies investigating the static endurance of various muscle groups have shown that the diﬀerence in endurance between conditions of cuﬀocclusion and no occlusion disappears when the force level reaches  40–60% of maximal voluntary isometric action (MVIA), (Bonde-Petersen et al., 1975; Hisaeda et al.,2001). This can be explained by the intramuscular occlusion of the blood ﬂow which occurs due to the high pressure in the muscle (Sadamoto et al., 1983;Sejerstedt et al., 1984; Sjøgaard et al., 1988). Until recently, little data existed about the eﬀects of cuﬀocclusion on endurance during conventional dy namic resistance training. Using a wide tourniquet and a pressure of 200 mmHg during the dynamic knee extension exercise with coupled concentric–eccentric actions, Wernbom et al. (2006) demon strated signiﬁcant diﬀerences in the number of repetitions performed between occluded and non occluded conditions for loads of 20–40% of 1RM,but not for 50% of 1RM, when the exercise was performed continuously with no relaxation of the quadriceps. Thus, similarly to continuous isometric exercise, the application of a pressure cuﬀaround the thigh appears to reduce knee extension endurance at low loads but not at moderate and heavier loads.

However, although the tourniquet aﬀected the endurance at 20–40% of 1RM, these diﬀerences were minor at 30% and especially 40%. Further more, the subjects experienced ischemic pain in the working quadriceps even without a pressure cuﬀand

at loads as low as 20% of 1RM. In support of these ﬁndings, Shoemaker et al. (1994) noted that the blood ﬂow to the quadriceps was inadequate during continuous dynamic knee extension exercise at a load as low as 10% of MVIA. Further evidence that intramuscular restriction of blood ﬂow can occur at low intensities was provided by de Ruiter et al.(2007), who showed that the oxygenation level in the vastus lateralis and medialis during isometric knee extensions reached values similar to total cuﬀocclusion already at torques of  25% of MVIA.

Muscle blood ﬂow mainly occurs in the relaxation period between muscle actions (Bangsbo & Hellsten,1998). Therefore, the dynamic knee extension, pre ferably in a cam-type machine with variable resis tance, can be used to induce relative ischemia already at loads of  20–30% of 1RM if performed in a non-stop manner to fatigue and with short rest periods (e.g., 15–45 s) between sets. Other quadriceps exercises can also be modiﬁed to achieve intramus cular restriction of blood ﬂow. During closed kinetic chain exercises such as the squat and the leg press,the force demands of the movement dictate that the electrical activity of the quadriceps is high at ﬂexed knee angles $( 9 0 ^ { \circ } - 1 0 0 ^ { \circ } )$and low near full-knee exten sion (Andersen et al., 2006). If the range of motion instead is limited to between 501 and 1001 of ﬂexion, the muscle activity remains fairly high throughout the movement and intramuscular occlu sion is thus more likely to occur.

Several studies (Takarada & Ishii, 2002; Tanimoto & Ishii, 2006; Popov et al., 2006) have demonstrated muscle hypertrophy in the quadriceps as a result of conventional training with high work/rest ratios at intensities of ∼50% of 1RM. Also, Laurentino et al. (2008) did not ﬁnd any enhanced strength and hypertrophy in the quadriceps when cuﬀocclusion was added at training loads of  60% and  80%of 1RM. In our laboratories, we have noted high levels of muscle activity even without tourniquets at loads as low as 20–30% of 1RM in some exercises such as dynamic knee extensions, with the no-relaxa tion technique performed all-out to fatigue (manu script in preparation). We therefore speculate that hypertrophy is possible without pressure cuﬀs even at these low intensities. In this context, it is noteworthy that in the occlusion training studies published to date, the groups that have trained without tourni quets have generally not trained to failure, whereas the occlusion groups have.

Intuitively, a training model which is based on the muscles own internal restriction of blood ﬂow would have advantages both from a safety point of view and from a practical point of view. On the other hand, in certain muscle groups and in some individuals, it may be diﬃcult to induce relative ischemia at low loads by exercise alone, due to factors such as

insuﬃcient intramuscular pressures developed during exercise. Furthermore, it is possible that there are diﬀerences between the muscle ischemia resulting from exercise alone and the ischemia induced with a tourniquet in combination with exercise (e.g., a greater build-up of metabolites in the cuﬀ-occluded muscle), which in turn could lead to diﬀerences in the stimulation of hypertrophic pathways. Future studies should compare the eﬀects of ischemic training with and without cuﬀocclusion at the same level of eﬀort.

## Dose–response aspects of ischemic training

A strength training program can be described by a number of variables, the most important being frequency, intensity, volume, and mode of training.Conventional heavy resistance training for the pur pose of gaining muscle mass is usually performed for two to three sessions per week per muscle group, and most rehabilitation programs aiming to restore mus cle volume use similar training frequencies. A recent review (Wernbom et al., 2007) suggested that the average rate of gain for the quadriceps as a result of strength training for two to three sessions per week is in the order of∼0.11% increase in CSA per day. In the study of Abe et al. (2005a), in which unusually rapid gains were noted (  0.57% increase per day on average), training was performed for two sessions per day, 6 days per week for a total of 12 sessions per week. This may seem like an extremely high fre quency, but the authors speculated that because of the low mechanical stress (20% of 1RM) and little muscle damage, a much shorter recovery time be tween sessions was needed in comparison to conven tionalstrengthtraining.Althoughthetraining included three sets of 15 repetitions, it is likely that the ﬁrst two sets served to accumulate fatigue and that only the ﬁnal set of each exercise was performed with a high level of eﬀort. However, the training period was very short (2 weeks) and the gains were markedly slower during the second week than the ﬁrst. It is therefore uncertain whether this frequency can be eﬀective for longer periods or if overtraining would occur. From an adherence point of view, such a high frequency is unrealistic for most people.

Normal frequencies (two to three times per week)have also been used with marked hypertrophy of the quadriceps as a result (Takarada et al., 2002, 2004;Kubo et al., 2006; Madarame et al., 2008). The rates of hypertrophy observed in these four studies were between 0.04% and 0.22%/day (Table 1), which is within the range reported for conventional heavy resistance training (0.03–0.26%/day) at similar fre quencies (reviewed by Wernbom et al., 2007). How ever, in these studies, multiple sets to failure or near were used. It is currently unknown if multiple sets of

fatiguing ischemic training is productive at higher frequencies than two to three sessions per week.Equally unknown is whether low-intensity ischemic strength training in which only the ﬁnal set is performed with a high degree of eﬀort can induce hypertrophy when performed for two to three ses sions per week. At present, the interactions between frequency, intensity, and volume in ischemic strength training are not well understood.

Not all modes of ischemic training are associated with increases in muscle strength and/or marked increases in muscle protein content. Eiken et al.(1991) investigated the eﬀects of partial occlusion in a one-leg endurance cycling model and demonstrated an 8% decrease in maximum peak torque after 4weeks of training, four times per week for 45 min per session. This occurred in spite of increased muscle ﬁber CSAs of both type I and type II ﬁbers in the ischemic leg in comparison with the normally trained leg. The authors speculated that the decreased max imum strength in the ischemic leg was due to an increased proportion of type I ﬁbers that was evident in this leg after the training period compared with the normal leg, suggesting that a ﬁber type shift had occurred. In a later study from the same research group, increases in both mean ﬁber area (12%) and quadriceps muscle CSA (5%) were noted along with increasedglycogencontentintheischemically trained muscles (Nygren et al., 2000). These authors then went on to investigate the eﬀect of glycogen loading on muscle CSA and found that quadriceps muscle CSA increased by 3.5% when the subjects went from a glycogen depleted state to a loaded state during the course of 4 days (Nygren et al., 2001).These authors concluded that glycogen loading might contribute to the increase in muscle CSA seen after ischemic training. It should be noted that the increase in glycogen content as a result of glyco gen loading from a depleted state was  1.7 times

larger than the increase seen after ischemic cycling.

Taken together, it appears that ischemic endurance cycling, as performed in the studies of Eiken, Nygren and colleagues, leads to only minor increases in contractile protein content in the trained muscles.Interestingly, similar increases in glycogen content have been noted after ischemic strength training (Burgomaster et al., 2003). However, because signiﬁcant strength gains are usually reported and because several studies have demonstrated gains in muscle CSA that have been substantially larger than  3%,the contribution of increases in glycogen content to the hypertrophy seen after this type of training is probably minor.

It is not immediately obvious why walk training with tourniquets (Abe et al., 2006) seems to be a better mode for inducing increases in both muscle strength and size than ischemic endurance cycling.

Hypertrophy training is generally short lasting and on the strength/power side of the strength-endurance continuum (Nader, 2006). Accordingly, it is possible that performing ischemic training in short intermit tent working sets may cause the exercise-induced signaling to be more directed toward hypertrophic adaptations compared with longer continuous bouts.Also, longer ischemic bouts are associated with marked increases in plasma cortisol (Viru et al.,1998), which potentially cancel out some of the anabolic eﬀects of the exercise. Diﬀerences in train ing frequency and/or the degree and pattern of ischemia–reperfusion may also contribute to the diﬀerent results for walk training with tourniquets compared with ischemic cycle training.

## Low-to-moderate load ischemic training as an addition to heavy resistance exercise

In a series of studies, the group of Takamatsu and colleagues investigated the eﬀects of adding fatiguing low-to-moderate intensity sets after high-intensity sets on adaptations in muscle strength and size as well as on acute hormonal responses (Choi et al.,1998; Masuda et al., 1999; Goto et al., 2003a, b,2004). Choi et al. (1998) demonstrated a high rate of increase in quadriceps muscle area after a regime where high-intensity sets (70–80% of 1RM) were followed by sets to fatigue at succeedingly lower loads (50–60% and 40–50% of 1RM), with 30 s rest periods between the decrements in loads. Similar regimes of multiple sets to exhaustion with little or no rest between the decreasing loads are often performed by bodybuilders. Choi et al. (1998) and Masuda et al. (1999) also showed that this type of regime resulted in greater increases in whole muscle area and muscle ﬁber area compared with a pure high-intensity (90% of 1RM) routine.

Goto et al. (2003a, 2004) investigated the eﬀects of adding a single moderate-intensity (50% of 1RM) set performed to failure after multiple high-intensity (90% of 1RM) sets and found both larger acute increases in GH and greater increases in quadriceps muscle CSA and strength over time compared with performing only high-intensity sets. Goto et al.(2004) speculated that the greater GH response seen with the combined regime could be an impor tant factor, but also acknowledged that the increased volume of work may have provided a stronger stimulus for muscle hypertrophy. In addition, it is possible that some local mechanisms were enhanced due to the more sustained ischemia (e.g., greater production of prostaglandins and/or phosphatidic acid in the working muscles). Because of the rela tively few studies that have been performed to date on combined or hybrid regimes, further research is obviously needed to establish whether low-to-mod-

## Wernbom et al.

erate intensity ischemic training has an additive eﬀect also when added to an already very eﬀective high intensity routine.

Potential disadvantages of low-load ischemic training compared with conventional heavy resistance training

Training with lighter loads implicates that compres sion forces on bones and joints as well as strain on tendons are reduced compared with traditional strength training. In the late 1800s, it was observed that bone architecture adapts to mechanical loading so that the trabecular patterns coincide with the trajectories of the mechanical stresses (Wolﬀ, 1892,translated by Maquet and Furlong, 1986). Later workers have extended this concept and proposed that bone strength adapts chieﬂy to peak momentary loads (Frost, 2001). In support, cross-sectional stu dies of diﬀerent types of athletes have demonstrated that adaptations in bone mineral density (BMD) are load dependent (e.g., Nevill et al., 2004). Similary,longitudinal studies have shown that increases in BMD are greater after maximal eccentric training than maximal concentric training (Hawkins et al.,1999) and after high-load conventional strength trainingcomparedwithmoderate-loadtraining (Kerr et al., 1996). Consequently, it is reasonable to assume that light-resistance occlusion training has less impact on bone metabolism than traditional high-load strength training. However, training with vascular occlusion can increase markers of bone turnover (Beekley et al., 2005), so it remains to be shown how this type of training aﬀects bones over time and if it is a useful tool in the prevention of bone mineral loss in various situations of inactivity.

The adaptations of tendons to training vary with the mode of exercise performed (e.g., Simonsen et al.,1995; Kubo et al., 2001) and high-resistance training seems to increase stiﬀness of human tendons (Kubo et al., 2001; Reeves et al., 2003; Kongsgaard et al.,2007). In a recent study by Kubo et al. (2006), young males trained one leg with high-load (80% of 1RM)dynamic knee extensions and the other with low-load (20% of 1RM) knee extensions under conditions of vascular occlusion. After 12 weeks of training, both protocols resulted in signiﬁcant increases in muscle strength, and the gains in muscle volume of the quadriceps femoris were similar for the two limbs.However, only the high-load protocol signiﬁcantly increased stiﬀness in the tendon–aponeurosis com plex. Furthermore, only the leg that had been trained with the high-load protocol showed increases in EMG, muscle activation and speciﬁc tension. In

support of the importance of load or strain magni tude, Arampatzis et al. (2007) reported increased Achilles tendon stiﬀness and CSA after 14 weeks of training with isometric contractions at 90% of MVC,whereas isometric contractions at 55% of MVC had no eﬀect on the tendon stiﬀness or CSA. In sum mary, it seems reasonable to suggest that while the eﬀects of blood ﬂow-restricted training at low loads and traditional heavy-resistance training on muscle volume are similar, the eﬀects of low-load ischemic training on tendons, and possibly also on neural adaptations, are less than with conventional strength training.

## Perspectives

The research on resistance exercise performed during ischemic conditions has so far provided important new insights into the physiology of strength training.In addition to being a possible alternative or comple ment to conventional high-load resistance training in certain situations, ischemic strength training may also have a place in sports training. Because relative ischemia can be induced at rather low loads in certain exercises even without tourniquets, external pressure may not always be necessary to achieve signiﬁcant training eﬀects. Also, any unique eﬀects of cuﬀocclusion per se during exercise have yet to be determined because the increased training eﬀects observed in the studies published to date may simply have been due to greater eﬀort. With reference to training combined with cuﬀocclusion, current evi dence suggests that this mode of exercise is relatively safe, but more research is needed especially regarding the potential adverse eﬀects on soft tissues.
