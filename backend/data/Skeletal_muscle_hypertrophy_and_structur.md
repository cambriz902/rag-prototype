Needle biopsy samples were taken from vastus lateralis muscle (VL) of ﬁve male body builders (BB, age 27.4 ± 0.93 years; mean ± S.E.M.), who had being performing hypertrophic heavy resistance exercise (HHRE) for at least 2 years, and from ﬁve male active, but untrained control subjects (CTRL, age 29.9 ± 2.01 years). The following determinations were performed:anatomicalcross-sectionalareaandvolumeofthequadricepsandVLmusclesinvivobymagnetic resonance imaging (MRI); myosin heavy chain isoform (MHC) distribution of the whole biopsy samples by SDS-PAGE; cross-sectional area (CSA), force $( P _ { 0 } )$, speciﬁc force (Po/CSA) and $( V _ { o } )$ of a large population (n = 524) of single skinned muscle maximum shortening velocity ﬁbres classiﬁed on the basis of MHC isoform composition by SDS-PAGE; actin sliding velocity $( V _ { f } )$ on pure myosin isoforms by in vitro motility assays. In BB a preferential hypertrophy of fast and especially type 2X ﬁbres was observed. The very large hypertrophy of VL in vivo could not be fully accounted for by single muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy. CSA of VL in vivo was, in fact, 54%larger in BB than in CTRL, whereas mean ﬁbre area was only 14% larger in BB than in CTRL.MHC isoform distribution was shifted towards 2X ﬁbres in BB. $P _ { o } / C$SA was signiﬁcantly lower in type 1 ﬁbres from BB than in type 1 ﬁbres from CTRL whereas both type 2A and type 2X ﬁbres were signiﬁcantly stronger in BB than in CTRL. $V _ { o }$ of type 1 ﬁbres and $V _ { f }$of myosin 1were signiﬁcantly lower in BB than in CTRL, whereas no difference was observed among fast ﬁbres and myosin 2A. The ﬁndings indicate that skeletal muscle of BB was markedly adapted to HHRE through extreme hypertrophy, a shift towards the stronger and more powerful ﬁbre types and an increase in speciﬁc force of muscle ﬁbres. Such adaptations could not be fully accounted for by well known mechanisms of muscle plasticity, i.e. by the hypertrophy of single muscle ﬁbre (quantitative mechanism) and by a regulation of contractile properties of muscle ﬁbres based on MHC isoform content (qualitative mechanism). Two BB subjects took anabolic steroids and three BB subjects did not. The former BB differed from the latter BB mostly for the size of their muscles and muscle ﬁbres.

It is well established that skeletal muscle can adapt to the variable functional requirements through a quantitative mechanism based on changes in muscle mass and ﬁbre size, and a qualitative mechanism based on a change in ﬁbre type distribution. Human muscles are in fact mixed muscles expressing three main ﬁbre types, type 1, 2A and

2X in variable proportions (Harridge et al. 1996). Type 1, 2A and 2X ﬁbres, in turn, differ in contractile and energetic properties that are known to depend on their myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoform content (Bottinelli &Reggiani, 2000). Type 1 ﬁbres contain the myosin heavy chain 1 (MHC-1) isoform and have lower maximum shortening velocity (V o), maximum power (W max) and ATPase activity (ATPase), and slower kinetics of stretch activation (Hilber et al. 1999) than type 2X ﬁbres, which

contain MHC-2X (Bottinelli et al. 1996; Stienen et al.1996). Type 2A ﬁbres contain MHC-2A and are inter mediate. Moroever, speciﬁc force (Po/CSA) is also lower in type 1 than in type 2A and 2X ﬁbres, whereas no difference is seen between 2A and 2X ﬁbres.

Exercise training is a major factor shaping muscle phenotype. Resistance training has been studied exten sively and it is now well known that it determines both muscle hypertrophy (quantitative mechanism) and a shift of ﬁbre type distribution (qualitative mechanism)(Schiafﬁno & Reggiani, 1996; Bottinelli & Reggiani, 2000;Fluck & Hoppeler, 2003). However, several open issues remain.

According to a long-lasting (Morpurgo, 1879) and well supportedbelief(Gollnick etal.1981;Gollnicketal.1983),it is generally assumed that the increase in muscle mass can befullyaccountedforbysinglemuscleﬁbrehypertrophy.It shouldbenoted,however,thatseveralﬁndingssuggestthat hyperplasiacanalsooccur,atleastinsomeanimals(rat,cat,chicken) and in some conditions (compensatory hyper trophy due to synergist ablation and tenotomy; chronic stretch; resistance training) (Antonio & Gonyea, 1993).Moreover,thefewstudiesperformedonbodybuildershave generally reported a limited and inconsistent hypertrophy of muscle ﬁbres, failing to account for the obvious and extreme hypertrophy of the muscles, although a precise quantitativeanalysiswasnotperformed(MacDougalletal.1982; Tesch & Larsson, 1982).

As regards single muscle ﬁbre properties, it has been recentlyshownthatthemyosinisoform-baseddependence of contractile properties of muscle ﬁbres might have relevantexceptions(Bottinelli,2001).Inageinganddisuse,infact,speciﬁctension(Po/CSA)andunloadedshortening velocity (V o) of slow (type 1) and fast (type 2A and 2X)ﬁbres have been shown to change (Larsson et al. 1997;D’Antona et al. 2003). It is unclear whether changes in Po/CSA and $V _ { o }$ of muscle ﬁbres can also occur in young healthy subjects following training. In two recent studies on resistance training (Widrick et al. 2002; Shoepe et al.2003), an increase in CSA and force$( P _ { 0 } )$ of muscle ﬁbres,$V _ { o }$of slow and fast ﬁbres,but no change in Po/CSA and was observed, suggesting that the properties of a given ﬁbre type change mainly by a quantitative mechanism (increase in CSA and absolute force). However, an increase in $V _ { o }$ of type 1 and 2A ﬁbres has been observed in highly trained swimmers following a decrease in training intensity (Trappe et al. 2000), and variations in $P _ { o } / C S A$ have been observed in a very recent study on cross-country runners during a competitive season and changes in endurance training regime (Harber et al. 2004).

Finally, it is still unclear how large and how relevant for muscle function in vivo the adaptation of ﬁbre type distribution to training can be (Ingalls, 2004). In longitudinal studies the training-induced shift in ﬁbre type composition is often small and surprisingly similar

for endurance (Baumann et al. 1987) (duration 8 weeks)and resistance training (Adams et al. 1993; Andersen et al. 1994; Liu et al. 2003a,b) (duration from 3 weeks to 3 months). A type2X→2A shift is mostly observed in spite of the different effects of the two paradigms on muscle mass and metabolism (Fluck & Hoppeler,2003). On the contrary, comparative studies of different subject populations (cross-sectional studies) have shown a strong bias in ﬁbre type distribution towards fast ﬁbres in elite sprinters (∼70% type 2A and type 2X) and towards slow ﬁbres in elite marathon runners (60–90%type 1 ﬁbres) (Sjostrom et al. 1988; Andersen et al. 2000).The inconsistency between the former (longitudinal)and the latter (cross-sectional) studies could be due either to the longer and more intense training of elite athletes ortoageneticallydeterminedbiasofﬁbretypedistribution towards fast ﬁbres in sprinters and slow ﬁbres in marathon runners.

To address the above issues, we reasoned that body builders (BB) in which muscle adaptations were expected to be particularly evident due to the very long and intense resistance training could represent a valuable model. BB that performed hypertrophic heavy resistance exercise (HHRE), a type of resistance training speciﬁcally designed to increase muscle mass, for at least 2 years to compete at national and international level were enrolled in the study.Muscle phenotype was characterized by extreme muscle hypertrophy, that could not be fully accounted for by singlemuscleﬁbrehypertrophy,byasigniﬁcantexpression of MHC-2X, the fastest and most powerful MHC isoform which is very little present in trained young subjects (Mizuno, 1991), and by a signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc force of fast and especially 2X muscle ﬁbres in relation to controls. Muscle phenotype was therefore clearlyadaptedtoHHRE,butsuchadaptationwasnotfully accounted for by the known qualitative and quantitative mechanisms of muscle plasticity.

A preliminary report of the present data has been presented in abstract form (Pellegrino et al. 2003).

### Methods

## Subjects

Five male, body-building athletes (BB) (body weight 77.5 ± 3.4 kg; height 170.0 ± 3.3 cm; age 27.4 ± 0.93years; means ± s.e.m.), volunteered to participate in the study. HHRE had been systematically and continuously practised for at least 2 years in order to participate in national and international competitions. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the University of Pavia and conformed to the standards set by the Declaration of Helsinki (last modiﬁed in 2000). After subjects were fully informed of the goal of the experiments and of the risks involved in the bioptic procedure,

written informed consent was obtained. Five male subjects (age 29.9 ± 4.5 years; height 178±3.5 cm; weight 75.3 ± 4.4 kg) performing recreational physical activity,butwithnoprevioushistoryofresistancetrainingorofany other speciﬁc training, were recruited as a control group (CTRL).

### Training

A careful diary of the past 2 years and speciﬁcally of the last 12 weeks of training was collected. Athletes were engaged in a classical model of progressive resistance training that targets all major upper and lower muscle groups. Over the previous year resistance training was conducted no less than three times per week. A heavy resistance hyper trophic protocol consisted of medium high loads (60–80%of one-repetition maximum strength or 1RM) with multiple repetitions (6–12) performed in each working set (4–5). There were 1–2 min rest periods between sets at moderate velocity of contraction (1–2 s concentric and 1–2 seccentric).Fivedifferentresistance-trainingexercises for legs were performed in the ﬁxed order: incline leg press;hack squat; knee extension; hamstring curl; and calf raise (Kraemer et al. 2002).

## Diet

Athletes assumed a hyperproteic diet, with a protein intake of 1.5–2.5 g per kg each day.

## Drug consumption and hormonal exams

A careful pharmacological anamnesis was collected. Three athletes declared they had not taken any drug, whereas two athletes declared they had taken an androgenic-anabolic steroid (AAS) regimen. They have reported the use of high dosage of several types of anabolic steroids simultaneously (‘staking’ therapy: testosterone, nandrolone decanoate,stanozolol,metandienone).Thedrugsweretakenassumed in cycles: a drug free period was followed by an increased dosage to a maximum to anticipate peak performance.Biochemical and hormonal exams were collected in order to evaluate clinical conditions and drug abuse that was not declared. The two athletes that declared AAS abuse showed a hormonal proﬁle of anabolic steroid-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, due to the drug-free period of the cycling therapy. No indications of drug abuse were found in biochemical and hormonal exams of the three BB that declared they had not taken any drug.

## Muscle biopsies

Muscle samples (about 50–100 mg) were obtained from the mid right vastus lateralis (VL) muscle of all subjects by needle biopsy (Bergstrom, 1962), 4 days after the last

exercise involving quadriceps muscle. After the biopsy,muscle samples were put in skinning solution at ∼4.0◦C,divided in small ﬁbre bundles (∼100 ﬁbres each) and ﬁnally stored at −20◦C in skinning solution and 50%glycerol for up to 3 weeks before experiment. Bundles were mostly used for dissection of single muscle ﬁbres for determination of CSA, force $( P _ { o } )$ and maximum shortening velocity $( V _ { o } )$, for dissection of single muscle ﬁbres for myosin extraction and in vitro motility assays experiments, and for determination of MHC isoform distribution by SDS-PAGE. Some small bundles of some biopsies were left after such experiments and were used for dissection of single muscle ﬁbres to precisely determine the shape of the cross-section of single muscle ﬁbres from control and BB subjects (see below).

## Single ﬁbre analysis

Cross-sectionalarea(CSA),forceandmaximum shortening velocity of single muscle ﬁbres were analysed as previously described in detail (Bottinelli et al.1994, 1996). The following solutions were prepared as previouslydescribed(Bottinellietal.1994,1996):skinning solution: 150 mm potassium propionate, 5 mm KH2PO4,5 mm magnesium acetate, 3 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm EGTA,pCa 9.0; relaxing solution: 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole,5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm $N a _ { 2 } A$TP, 5 mm EGTA, pCa 9.0;preactivating solution: 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole,5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 300 U ml−1 creatine kinase, pCa 8.0;and activating solution: 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole,5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na2ATP, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm creatine phosphate, 300 U ml−1 creatine kinase, pCa 4.5. The pH of all solutions was set at 7.0. Brieﬂy, segments of single ﬁbres were manually isolated from muscle bundles with the help of a stereomicroscope. The ﬁbres were immersed for 1 h in a solution containing 1% Triton X-100 and afterward returned to the previous skinning solution.Using a dissecting microscope at 40-60×magniﬁcation,light aluminium clips were attached to both ends of the ﬁbre segments (1.5–2 mm long), which were then transferred to the experimental set-up for mechanical measurements. The set-up enabled the determination of the CSA of muscle ﬁbre segments, isometric force (Po) and unloaded shortening velocity ($V _ { o } )$ by the slack test technique. Experiments were performed at 12◦C,in conditions of maximal activation (pCa 4.5) and at optimal sarcomere length for force developing (Bottinelli & Reggiani, 2000; D’Antona et al. 2003).

## Determination of ﬁbre cross-sectional area

and of its shape

The set-up was placed on the stage of an inverted micro scope (Axiovert 10, Zeiss, Germany) that enabled viewing

of the ﬁbre segment at 320× magniﬁcation. As previously described (Bottinelli et al. 1994; D’Antona et al. 2003),CSA was calculated from the mean of three diameters measured along the length of the ﬁbre segment looking at it from below through the eyepieces of the inverted micro scope. Skeletal muscle ﬁbres did not always have a circular cross-section. In this latter case, due to the procedure used to mount the ﬁbre in the apparatus, the larger of the two main diameters was that viewed from below. As CSA was calculated assuming a circular shape, an over-estimation of CSA could occur. The extent of such over-estimation was going to depend on the shape of the cross-section of the ﬁbres: the less circular the shape, the larger could be the over-estimation. To make sure that variation in the shape of the cross-section of skinned muscle ﬁbres between control subjects and body builders, and between slow and fast ﬁbres did not introduce a systematic error in the measurements of CSA, two control experiments were performed. Such experiments assessed the ratio between the larger and smaller diameters of a population of ﬁbres from both subject groups and suggested that such ratio,and therefore the shape of the CSA, was not different in CTRL and BB and between slow and fast ﬁbres.

The ﬁrst experiment was designed to assess very precisely the CSA of identiﬁed types of single muscle ﬁbres in the same set-up and conditions used for functional analysis. Few ﬁbre bundles were left after all analyses were performed and were used for this purpose. Such bundles enabled dissection of extra ﬁbres from three control subjects and three BB(n=50 from controls and n=50 from BB). Fibre segments (1–2 mm long) were laid down straight at the bottom of a muscle chamber ﬁlled with preactivating solution. Ten diameters were determined at 320× magniﬁcation along the length of each segment turning it along its longitudinal axis to make sure that all the representative diameters could be measured.Fibreswerethereaftercharacterizedonthebasis of MHC isoform composition. The larger diameter was calculated averaging the ﬁve larger diameters and the smaller diameter was calculated averaging the ﬁve smaller diameters. Both the larger and the smaller diameter were used to determine the CSA of the ﬁbres assuming an elliptical shape (the approach that provides a more precise assessment of CSA), whereas the larger diameter only was used to determine the CSA of the ﬁbres assuming a circular shape (the approach that for technical reasons is mostly used during mechanical experiments on skinned ﬁbres). The whole procedure to determine the two CSAs was chosen on purpose to assess the largest error that can be possibly involved in CSA determination during mechanical experiments. The difference between the CSA calculated assuming an elliptical and circular shape was:1.18 ± 0.15-fold for the slow ﬁbres of controls (n=28);1.20 ± 0.17 for the fast ﬁbres of controls (a pool of 2A,2X and 2AX ﬁbre, n=22);1.17±0.15 for the slow ﬁbres

of BB(n=20); and 1.20±0.16for the fast ﬁbres of BB (n=30).

The second experiment took advantage of some small ﬁbre bundles that were frozen immediately after the biopsy and determined the ratio between the larger and smaller diameterofindividualﬁbresonhistologicalcross-sections.As discussed below, the size of the biopsy did not enable us to store muscle bundles of the appropriate size to perform a detailed immuno-histochemical analysis of the CSAoftheﬁbres.However,atthebeginningoftheresearch project some bundles of three BB subjects and some bundles of one control subject were frozen after being skinned for 2 hours on the day of the biopsy. Such bundles turned out to be far too small to enable determination of CSA on a large number of ﬁbres. Moreover, they could not be spared from all biopsies and subjects.Consequently, a systematic analysis of CSA was performed on isolated single ﬁbres during mechanical experiments.However, some bundles could be immuno-stained with two monoclonal antibodies against MHC-1 (BA-F8;DSMZ – Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany) and MHC-2A (SC-71;DSMZ) and could be used for determination of the larger and smaller diameter of a population of 120 individual muscle ﬁbres using freely available image analysis software (ScionImage,ScionCorp.,USA).AFigure oftheimmuno stainedcross-sectionsispresentedason-lineSupplemental material. As the bundles were skinned and very small,such determination should provide results qualitatively comparable to those obtained from the determination on isolated single skinned ﬁbres (see above). The difference between the CSA calculated assuming an elliptical and circular shape using the diameters from immuno-stained cross-sections was:  1.20±0.15((n=28) for the slow ﬁbres of the control; 1.22 ± 0.13 (n = 30) for the fast ﬁbres of the control subjects; 1.17±0.13(n=30)for the slow ﬁbres of the BB subjects; and 1.22 ± 0.17 (n = 32) for the fast ﬁbres of BB subjects. Therefore, both experiments performed to check the possible error involved in determining CSA during a mechanical experiment indicate that, at the most,the overestimation of the CSA could be 20% and, more importantly,thattheshapeofthecross-sectionoftheﬁbres was the same in CTRL and BB and in slow and fast ﬁbres.Therefore, no systematic bias can be introduced by the way CSA has been routinely determined during mechanical experiments and the data of CSA and Po/CSA of single ﬁbres could be safely used for comparative purposes between controls and BB.

As regards the error in determining the size of the ﬁbres at 320× magniﬁcation, the diameter of the ﬁbres was determined using a scale in the eyepiece of the micro scope, having small divisions of 2.96 µm. The width of one division represents the largest possible error of the measurements.Astheaveragediameteroftheﬁbresranged between 28 and 40 divisions, the largest possible error in

CSA determination using the scale in the eyepiece ranged between 3.5 and 2.5% and was the same for all specimens.

## Myosin isoforms identiﬁcation

Separation and identiﬁcation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms was performed as previously described (Bottinelli et al. 1996; D’Antona et al. 2003). Brieﬂy,samples were dissolved in Laemmli solution (Laemmli,1970) and loaded on 6% polyacrylamide gels. Electro phoresis was run for 20 h at 100 V. Samples were eitherthesinglemuscleﬁbresegmentsusedfor mechanical experiments or ﬁbre bundles obtained from the biopsy sample. To ensure that the latter samples were representative of the whole biopsy, cross-sections about 1 mm long of all the bundles of the biopsy were pooled.Electrophoresis of single muscle ﬁbre segments were silver stained,assuchstaining,beingmoresensitive,ispreferable when small amounts of protein are to be detected. Electro phoresis of ﬁbre bundles were coomassie (Brilliant Blue R-250) stained, as such staining enables a more precise quantiﬁcation of the protein bands on gels. In the region of MHC isoforms, three major bands were separated that corresponded, in order of migration from the fastest to the slowest, to MHC-1 or MHC-2A and MHC-2X. In relation to the presence of one or two bands in the MHC region, single ﬁbres were classiﬁed in one of the following types: 1, 2A, 2X (pure ﬁbres) and 1–2A, 2A–2X (mixed ﬁbres) (D’Antona et al. 2003). In all BB a fourth, faint band was observed (Fig. 1, lanes 2–3). The myosin nature of the band was assessed by extracting myosin from the muscle bundles, using an extraction procedure previously described (Canepari et al. 1999), and loading pure myosin on gels (Fig. 1). The neonatal nature of the protein band was demonstrated loading in adjacent lanes (Fig. 1, lanes 4–5) the biopsy sample from BB with a muscle sample fromanelderlyimmobilizedsubject,whichwaspreviously demonstrated to contain a fourth MHC corresponding to neonatal MHC (MHC-neo) (D’Antona et al. 2003). In the gel of Fig. 1 (lane 5), the BB sample was overloaded to maketheMHC-neobandmoreevident.Thelatterindirect approach was necessary as the only available antibody againsthumanMHC-neonatal(NCL-MHCn,Novocastra,Newcastle, UK) does not work on the denatured protein and therefore in Western blots. Densitometric scans of the four MHC bands were used to establish the relative proportion of the MHC isoforms identiﬁed in the biopsy samples (Harridge et al. 1996).

Myosin light chain (MLC) separation was performed as previously described (Bottinelli et al. 1994) on 10–20%linear polyacrylamide gradient slab gels. Two regulatory MLC isoforms, the slow isoform MLC2s and the fast isoform MLC2f, and three alkali MLC isoforms, the slow MLC1s and the two fast isoforms MLC1f and MLC3f, were separated.

## Myosin extraction and in vitro motility assays (IVMA)

To be able to study actin sliding velocity on pure myosin isoforms, an approach based on extraction of myosin from single pure ﬁbres was used (Canepari et al. 1999).As single ﬁbres mostly contain only a type of MHC isoform they are a convenient source of pure myosin isoforms. However, due to the short length of the ﬁbres in a needle biopsy sample, one ﬁbre segment does not provide sufﬁcient myosin to be used in IVMA. Therefore (i) single ﬁbres were dissected, (ii) SDS-PAGE was performed(Bottinelli etal.1994)toidentifyMHCisoform content, (iii) three to four ﬁbres shown to contain the same MHCisoformwerepooled,(iv)myosinwasextractedfrom pooled ﬁbres, and (v) this myosin was loaded in IVMA.The myosin samples were put as a drop on a coverslip with nitrocellulose, which was then used to construct the ﬂow cell. The IVMA was carried out as previously described (Anson et al. 1995; Canepari et al. 1999). The sliding of actin ﬁlaments was studied in an assay buffer of the following composition: 25 mm Mops (pH 7.2), 25 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 200 µg ml−1glucose oxidase, 36 µg ml−1 catalase, 5 mg glucose and 2 mm ATP. The actin sliding velocity (V f) on myosin samples was determinated at 25◦C, 50 mm ionic strength and pH 7.2. The analysis of the velocity of each sample was done as described by Canepari et al. (1999). For each myosin sample the velocities of about 50 ﬁlaments were measured and their distribution characterized according to parametric statistics.

## Anatomical CSA of vastus lateralis muscles

Muscle CSA and volume were measured from spin-echo,T1-weighted axial magnetic resonance images (MRI)recorded with a 0.3-tesla magnet (Siemens, Germany).

Figure 1. Electrophoretic (SDS-PAGE) separation of myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms in bioptic samples of vastus lateralis muscles from control subjects and body builders (BB)All samples were pure myosin extracted from muscle bundles. Gels were coomassie stained. Lane 1: sample from a control subject; lane 2–3: samples from two BB; lane 4: sample from the vastus lateralis muscle of an elderly immobilized subject from D’Antona et al. (2003);lane 5: sample from a BB subject. The area of migration of MHC-1, 2A,2X and MHC-neonatal (MHC-neo) is indicated in the middle. In lane 2and 3 (BB) a fourth MHC band in addition of the three adult MHC is observed. In lanes 5 such an extra band is identiﬁed as MHC-neo as it comigrates with a MHC band previously identiﬁed as MHC-neo in the vastus lateralis sample loaded in lane 4 (D’Antona et al. 2003). Lane 5is overloaded to make the faint band of MHC-neo more visible.

To minimize the potential inﬂuence of ﬂuid shifts on muscle size in the transition from the upright position, the subject remained supine for half an hour prior of the start of scanning (Tesch et al. 2004). Subjects also refrained from excessive muscle exercise for 4 days before the MRI.Seven axial slices (slice thickness 10 mm) interspaced by a distance of 1/10 femur length were obtained at 20,30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80% of femur length. Anatomical CSA (ACSA) of the quadriceps muscle was determined in each axial image using public domain software package (Scion Image Beta 4.0.2 for Windows, Scion Corporation,Frederick, MD, USA). Volumes were calculated by the summation of successive CSA values, each multiplied by the respective slice thickness and interslice distance. In the present study, athletes showed a lack of distinct fasciae boundaries between the lateral and deep vastii (VL and DV) and between the medial (MV) and deep vastii at the proximal axial MRI scans (Aagaard et al. 2001). However,ACSA of the vastus lateralis muscle could be determined in several slices and the ACSA at the level of the biopsy site was used for comparison.

## Mean ﬁbre area

For the purpose of the present study, it was interesting to evaluate whether hypertrophy of individual muscle ﬁbres could be sufﬁcient to account for the larger size of the wholevastuslateralismuscleassessedbyMRI.Forthelatter purpose mean ﬁbre area (MFA) of vastus lateralis muscle was determined from CSA of the individual muscle ﬁbres of CTRL and BB using the expression:

MFA=(%MHC-1×CSAtype1)+(%MHC-2A

×CSAtype2A)+(%MHC-2X×CSAtype 2X).

The CSA of individual ﬁbres was measured during the mechanical experiments used for force and velocity determinations. The size of the muscles samples obtained by needle biopsy was just sufﬁcient to enable dissection of the large number of ﬁbres required for mechanical experiments and for myosin extraction for in vitro motility assays. No bundles of the appropriate size for CSA determination on immunostained cross-sections could be spared. It should be noted that, although muscle ﬁbres swell upon skinning, i.e. their diameter increases ∼20%(Godt & Maughan, 1977), such a phenomenon does not limit the use of MFA for comparative purposes. The calculation of MFA assumes the same number of ﬁbres in the muscles considered, i.e. it actually determines the CSA of 100 ﬁbres of the vastus lateralis of BB and control subjects. MFA can provide a precise estimate of the percent increase in the CSA of the vastus lateralis muscle of BB expected on the basis of the differences in the CSA of individual muscle ﬁbre types between BB and control subjects. However, MFA determination is not meant to

provide a precise value of the actual whole muscle CSA.Since in humans for technical and ethical reasons it is not possible to determine the total number of ﬁbres in a muscle, MFA has been widely used for similar purposes.

## Statistical analysis

Datawereexpressedasmeans ± s.e.m.Statistical signiﬁcance of the differences between means was assessed by Student’s t test and ANOVA followed by the Student-Newman-Keuls test. A probability of less than 5%was considered signiﬁcant (P&lt;0.05).

## Results

As the body builders (BB) that took anabolic steroids and BB that did not take any drug were different only in a few of the parameters studied and all conclusions drawn from the data appeared independent from anabolic steroid misuse, the results of all BB subjects were pooled and reported together. The few signiﬁcant differences are brieﬂy reported at the end.

### Anatomical cross-sectional area of vastus

### lateralis muscle

Figure 2 shows coronal and axial images of the thighs at 50%femurlength,thelevelatwhichneedlebiopsysamples were obtained, of a CTRL and a BB subject. At this level not only the perimeter of the quadriceps, but also that of the vastus lateralis muscle could be identiﬁed and their anatomical cross-sectional areas could be determined. The mean values of the anatomical cross-sectional area of the quadriceps (ACSAqd) and of the vastus lateralis (ACSAvl)were signiﬁcantly higher in BB than in CTRL subjects with BB having$A C S A _ { q d }$ 34% larger and AC$S A _ { v l }$ 54%larger than CTRL (Fig. 3). The volume of the quadriceps could be determined using the approach reported in the methods and was found to be 1541 ± 39 cm3 in CTRL and 2093 ± 172 cm3 inBBwithadifferencebetweenCTRLand BB of 34%.

### MHC isoform distribution

The relative content in MHC-2X of vastus lateralis muscle was signiﬁcantly higher in BB than in controls, whereas the MHC-1wassigniﬁcantlylowerinBB(Fig. 4).InallBB,but in none of the controls, a small percentage (∼5%) of the neonatal isoform of MHC (MHC-neo) was observed.

### Single muscle ﬁbre analysis

(n=219)and the BB (n=305) subjects and used for functional analysis.

In CTRL subjects the CSA was signiﬁcantly higher in slow ﬁbres than in 2AX and 2X ﬁbres, whereas type 2A ﬁbres were intermediate (Fig. 5A). In contrast,in BB slow ﬁbres were signiﬁcantly smaller than fast (type 2A, 2AX and 2X) ﬁbres. Type 2A, 2AX and 2X ﬁbres were signiﬁcantly larger in BB than in CTRL, whereas no signiﬁcant difference was observed among type 1 and type 1–2A ﬁbres. Among fast ﬁbres, hypertrophy was signiﬁcantly more pronounced in type 2X and type 2AX ﬁbres than in type 2A ﬁbres. Type 2X and 2AX ﬁbres were 92% and 61% larger in BB than in CTRL, respectively,

whereas type 2A ﬁbres were 37% larger in BB than in CTRL.

To evaluate to what extent muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy could account for VL hypertrophy, mean ﬁbre area (MFA)of VL of BB and CTRL was determined combining MHC isoform distribution and CSA of individual muscle ﬁbres as described in Methods. MFA was found to be 14% larger in BB$( ( 9 4 0 \pm 6 3 ) \times 1 0 ^ { 3 } \mu m ^ { 2 } )$ than in CTRL ((826±54)×10µm2).ItshouldbepointedoutthatMFA enables just an estimate of the degree of whole muscle hypertrophy expected on the basis of single muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy. MFA is not meant to provide the actual CSA of a muscle (see Methods).

single muscle ﬁbre used for mechanical experiments from control subjects (CTRL) and from body builders (BB)Experiments were performed at 12◦C. CSA is expressed in µm2, $\rho _ { o } \in$ g, Po/CSA in kN m−2. Fibres were identiﬁed on the basis of their MHC isoform content by SDS-PAGE. The height of the bars represents the mean values (± S.E.M.). The numbers of ﬁbres per type and per group were: 80 (CTRL) and 84 (BB) for type 1; 20 (CTRL) and 21 (BB) for type 1–2A; 85 (CTRL) and 143 (BB) for type 2A; 19 (CTRL) and 34 (BB) for type 2AX; 15 (CTRL) and 23 (BB) for type 2X ﬁbres. ∗Signiﬁcantly different from CTRL (P &lt; 0.05).

Figure 5Bshowsthatabsoluteforce $( P _ { o } )$ was signiﬁcantly lower in type 1 and higher in type 2A and type 2X ﬁbres of BB than in the corresponding ﬁbre types of CTRL.

Figure 5C reports the mean values of speciﬁc force (Po/CSA) of the same ﬁbre population. As expected on the basis of previous ﬁndings (Bottinelli et al. 1996; Bottinelli & Reggiani, 2000), in both CTRL and BB, type 1 ﬁbres were weaker than type 2A, 2AX and 2X; type 1–2A ﬁbres being intermediate. More interestingly, type 1 ﬁbres were signiﬁcantly weaker in BB than in CTRL, whereas type 2A,2AX and 2X ﬁbres were signiﬁcantly stronger in BB than in CTRL.

As expected on the basis of previous ﬁndings (Bottinelli & Reggiani, 2000), $V _ { 0 }$of single muscle ﬁbres increased in the order 1→2A→2X in both CTRL and BB and hybrid ﬁbres were intermediate between pure ﬁbre types (Fig. 6). More interestingly, the comparison between corresponding ﬁbre types of BB and CTRL showed that type 1 ﬁbres had signiﬁcantly lower $V _ { o }$ in BB than in CTRL, whereas no difference was observed among type 2A and 2X ﬁbres. Analysis of myosin light chain (MLC) isoform composition of a subset(n=20)of type 1ﬁbres of CTRL and BB have shown that all ﬁbres contained only slow MLC isoforms (MLC1s and MLC2s) in both CTRL and BB. MLC isoform content could not explain therefore the lower $V _ { o }$of BB type 1 ﬁbres.

No ﬁbres used for mechanical experiments were found to contain MHC-neo. This is probably due to the small size of ﬁbres containing MHC-neo that makes the dissection of such ﬁbres infrequent (D’Antona et al. 2003).

molecule itself, velocity of sliding of actin on pure myosin isoforms was studied in in vitro motility assays (IVMA). As described in Methods, single muscle ﬁbres(n=180)were dissected, characterized and pooled together on the basis of MHC isoform content to enable extraction of sufﬁcient amounts of pure myosin isoforms to load in IVMA.

As expected on the basis of previous ﬁndings (Canepari et al. 2000; D’Antona et al. 2003), the velocity of sliding of actin (V f) was signiﬁcantly lower with myosin isoforms 1than with myosin isoforms 2A in both BB and controls.More interestingly, myosin 1 extracted from single muscle ﬁbres of BB propelled actin ﬁlaments at a lower speed$( V _ { f } )$than myosin 1 extracted from single muscle ﬁbres of CTRL (Fig. 7). No difference in $V _ { f }$was observed among myosin 2A of BB and CTRL, consistent with the lack of difference in $V _ { o }$of type 2A ﬁbres of CTRL and BB. It was not possible to obtain a sufﬁcient number of samples to compare the functioning of myosin 2X.

### Anabolic steroid misuse

The only signiﬁcant differences between the BB that took anabolic steroids (see Methods) and the BB that did not were found in the size of the muscles and of the muscle ﬁbres. ACSAqd and AC$S A _ { v l }$ were found to be signiﬁcantly higher in the former (116 ± 7.8 cm2and38 ± 0.2$c m ^ { 2 } ,$ respectively)thaninthelatter (92±6.6cm2 and 29 ± 1.2 cm2, respectively). CSA of type 2A and 2X ﬁbres were larger in BB that took anabolic drugs (12690 ± 387 µm2 and 11105 ± 543 µm2,respectively) than in BB that did not (8529 ± 355 µm2 and 81$7 6 \pm 6 9 8 \mu m ^ { 2 } ,$ respectively), whereas no difference was observed in CSA of type 1 ﬁbres. No statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two groups of BB were observed in all other parameters studied. Indeed, a trend for higher Po/CSA of fast ﬁbres in BB that used anabolic steroids in comparisonwithBBthatdidnotwasobservedconsistently with the observation that an increase in Po/CSA paralleled ﬁbre hypertrophy.

## Discussion

## Skeletal muscle hypertrophy

The values of CSA of the vastus lateralis and the volume of the quadriceps muscle of CTRL subjects here reported are fully consistent with recent determinations (Aagaard et al.2001).

The hypertrophy of the quadriceps muscles of the BB subjects enrolled in the study was very pronounced especially in the vastus lateralis muscle chosen for tissue sampling. The degree of hypertrophy of quadriceps (+38%) and of vastus lateralis (+54%) muscles is consistentwiththeonlypreviouscomparisonof muscle CSA in BB and controls performed on biceps

brachii (+35–75%) (MacDougall et al. 1984). An increase in muscle mass following resistance training is largely expected (Booth & Thomason, 1991; Fluck &Hoppeler, 2003). However, longitudinal studies, which were necessarily of short (2–14 weeks) duration, found a muchlowerdegreeofhypertrophy(6–10%)(Aagaardetal.2001; Tesch et al. 2004).

The hypertrophy of the quadriceps muscles of BB could be explained, to some extent, by the hypertrophy of single muscle ﬁbres (Fig. 5A). Hypertrophy appeared to spare slow ﬁbres, to selectively involve fast ﬁbres and,among fast ﬁbres, to be signiﬁcantly more pronounced in the fastest 2X ﬁbres (+72%) than in 2A ﬁbres(+37%).Preferential hypertrophy of fast ﬁbres following resistance training has been previously observed (Costill et al. 1979;Coyle et al. 1981; Sale et al. 1987; Sjostrom et al. 1988;

Upper panel: myosin 1; lower panel: myosin 2A. Experiments were performed at 25◦C. Vf is expressed in µm s−1. The numbers of samples studied per myosin isoform and per group were: 18 (CTRL)and 13 (BB) for myosin 1; 18 (CTRL) and 15 (BB) for myosin 2A. Each sample was obtained extracting myosin from a pool of 3–4 ﬁbres with the same MHC content.

Brown et al. 1990; Hather et al. 1991; Aagaard et al. 2001).However, due to the lower overall hypertrophies obtained in longitudinal studies the results were less clear than in the present study. Moreover, the lack of separation of type 2A and 2X ﬁbres did not enable us to compare the relative hypertrophy of the two fast ﬁbre types. The mechanism of such preferential hypertrophy is unclear.It might be that slow ﬁbres are less susceptible to hyper trophic stimuli. Indeed, a signiﬁcant hypertrophy of slow ﬁbres has been rarely observed (Cadefau et al. 1990;Widrick et al. 2002). It could also be that the very powerful,but short contractions performed during hypertrophic heavy resistance exercise do not put the same stress on fast and slow ﬁbres, as slow ﬁbres can sustain maximum contraction with very little fatigue for a long time. The much larger increase in activity of fast than of slow motor units during heavy resistance exercise in comparison to everyday use, expected on the basis of Henneman’s size principle (Henneman et al. 1974), might also play a role.

The observations that mean ﬁbre area of VL was 14% larger in BB than in CTRL, whereas ACSA of VL determined by MRI was 54% larger in the former than in the latter subjects suggest that single muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy cannot readily account for all the hyper trophy at whole muscle level. Interestingly, although a quantitative analysis was not performed, previous studies on BB showed very limited hypertrophy of muscle ﬁbres in the presence of a very evident hypertrophy of the muscle (MacDougall et al. 1982; Tesch & Larsson, 1982). On the contrary,longitudinalstudiesonresistancetraining,which also combined determination of CSA of the muscle by MRI or computerized tomography (CT) and of CSA of single muscle ﬁbres from biopsy samples, found a larger increase in MFA than in muscle CSA (Frontera et al. 1988;Aagaard et al. 2001; Esmarck et al. 2001), just the opposite of what was observed here. The latter observation suggests that other phenomena than the single muscle ﬁbre hyper trophy that occurs in longitudinal studies might become evident in BB due to the high intensity and long duration of HHRE. Among such phenomena the following need to be considered: increase in non-contractile tissue; changes in muscle architecture; ﬁbre hyperplasia.

Although some fatty tissue proliferation was found in skeletal muscle of BB (MacDougall et al. 1982), the relativecontentinconnectiveandnon-contractiletissuein muscles of BB and controls was not different (MacDougall et al. 1984), consistent with observations of a constant proportion of non-contractile tissue following resistance training in young healthy subjects (Mikesky et al. 1991;Roman et al. 1993).

It is well known now that the relation between the physiological CSA (PCSA), namely the sum of the CSAs of all individual muscle ﬁbres of a muscle, and the anatomical CSA (ACSA), namely the CSA of a muscle determined

in a plane axial to the long axis of a muscle, is not ﬁxed. The latter relation, in fact, varies according to the pennation angle, which is the angle between the axis of the ﬁbres and the axis of the muscle, and according to the length of the ﬁbres (Narici et al. 1996; Reeves et al.2004). Pennation angle has been seen to increase following resistance training (Kawakami et al. 1995) and to be larger in BB than in controls (Kawakami et al. 1993). As MRI assessed ACSA of VL whereas MFA is an index of PCSA of VL, an increase in pennation angle in BB must be considered as a possible source of discrepancy between the two estimates. Using a simple model of vastus lateralis architecture and known values of pennation angle (see Appendix), it can be shown that the large differences in ACSA and volume and the small difference in MFA between CTRL and BB can only be partially accounted for by differences in muscle architecture.

The hypothesis of an increase in ﬁbre number in BB has to face the long-lasting (Morpurgo, 1879) and well supported belief (Gollnick et al. 1981, 1983) that in adult animals muscle hypertrophy is due solely to single muscle ﬁbre hypertrophy. However, some evidence suggests that hyperplasia can actually occur in some animal (chicken and cat) and in some conditions (stretch-inducedhypertrophy)(Antonio&Gonyea,1993).In humans, for technical and ethical reasons the issue of hyperplasia versus hypertrophy can be addressed only indirectly, i.e. relating ﬁbre CSA (determined in vitro)and muscle CSA (determined in vivo) in conditions in which signiﬁcant hypertrophy occurs. The presence of MHC-neo in BB (Fig. 4) can be interpreted as an index of ﬁbre regeneration (Sartore et al. 1982)following exercise damage consistent with its observation in several muscular diseases characterized by necrosis and regeneration (Marini et al. 1991). However, the formation of new ﬁbres is also expected to determine a transient expression of developmental MHC isoforms as itislikelytorecapitulatetheformationofnewﬁbresduring development (Schiafﬁno & Reggiani, 1996). On this basis,ﬁbre hyperplasia has been recently suggested in BB (Kadi et al. 1999). Finally, the possibility that some contribution to a possible increase in ﬁbre number is given by ﬁbre splitting cannot be ruled out (Vaughan & Goldspink,1979).

## MHC isoforms distribution

The analysis of MHC distribution shows that BB have signiﬁcantly more MHC-2X isoform and less MHC-2A and MHC-1 isoforms in their vastus lateralis muscles than young active CTRL. That BB actually showed a bias towards a fast muscle phenotype is also suggested by the observation that their MHC isoform distribution

(MHC-2A+MHC-2X=61%) is similar to that of elite sprinters(MHC-2A+MHC-2X=69%) (Sjostrom et al.1988), the population that so far was found to have the fastest muscle phenotype. Moreover, as resistance training causes a MHC isoforms shift in the direction2X→2A the presence of a signiﬁcant amount (18%) of MHC-2X in the vastus lateralis of BB that heavily trained for long time is noteworthy. It appears therefore that the muscle phenotype of BB is built to perform the short and powerful contractions required by HHRE.

TheonlypreviousanalysisofMHCisoformdistribution in BB in which three ﬁbre types could be identiﬁed showed a lower MHC-2X content and a higher MHC-1 and MHC-2A content in BB than in CTRL (Klitgaard et al.1990). The discrepancy might depend on the different technique used to compare MHC isoform content, on the muscle analysed (biceps brachii versus vastus studied here), and on the group used as control (sedentary versus physically active in the present study). Counting the number of ﬁbres of different types in a muscle sample (Klitgaard et al. 1990) and determining the relative content of MHC isoforms by SDS-PAGE (present study)can provide different results especially if the size of the muscleﬁbreschangessigniﬁcantly(Harridgeetal.1996).A preferential hypertrophy of type 2X ﬁbres can determine an increase in MHC-2X content in the muscle with no change in the number of type 2X ﬁbres.

The inconsistency between longitudinal studies that show minor changes in the direction MHC-2X →MHC-2A (Campos et al. 2002; Fluck & Hoppeler, 2003;Hakkinen et al. 2003; Liu et al. 2003b) and cross-sectional studies on elite sprinters (Sjostrom et al. 1988) and on BB (this study) that show a bias towards fast ﬁbres might be due to genetic predisposition. Indeed, a genetically determinedhighertype2Xcontentwouldgiveasigniﬁcant advantage not only to sprinters, as type 2X are the fastest ﬁbres, but also to BB, as type 2X ﬁbres go through a larger hypertrophy than the other ﬁbre types. Alternatively the duration of resistance training, years for elite athletes and generally not more than 12–14 weeks in longitudinal studies on sedentary subjects, and the kind of training,very intense and frequent in elite athletes and BB, might actually determine a MHC-2A →MHC-2X shift.

Finally, the possible contribution of the diet to muscle phenotype has been mostly overlooked when comparing longitudinal studies on controls and cross-sectional studies on athletes. Controls in longitudinal studies are on anormaldietwhereasathletesarelikelytomodifytheirdiet especially when muscle hypertrophy is desirable. A hypo proteic diet has been related to a decrease in MHC-IIX fraction in humans (Brodsky et al. 2004), whereas amino acid supplementation has been shown to determine a slow to fast shift in some muscles in mice (Pellegrino et al. 2005). It cannot be ruled out that the hyperproteic

diet of BB bears some responsibility for their fast muscle phenotype.

## Contractile properties of individual ﬁbres

This study suggests that, although MHC isoform content remained the major determinant of force and velocity of muscle ﬁbres (in both BB and CTRL V o increased in the order1→2A→2Xand$P _ { o } / C$SAwashigherintype2Aand 2X than in type 1 ﬁbres), long-lasting hypertorphic heavy resistance exercise training and extreme muscle hyper trophy can play a modulatory role.

Signiﬁcant differences in Po/CSA between single muscle ﬁbres of BB and controls were observed. Interestingly, the variations were in the opposite direction in slow and fast ﬁbres. Whereas slow ﬁbres had lower Po/CSA, fast ﬁbres had higher Po/CSA in BB than in CTRL. Indeed fast ﬁbres of BB had higher Po/CSA values than corresponding ﬁbre types of any control population studied in our laboratory in the same experimental conditions (Bottinelli et al.1996; D’Antona et al. 2003). Such variations in $P _ { o } / C S A$ can be regarded as an adaptation of muscle ﬁbres to the requirements of the very powerful contractions against high loads performed during HHRE.

As it is generally assumed that the packing of the myoﬁbrils is constant, force of muscle ﬁbres should be strictly related to CSA (Eisenberg, 1983) and $P _ { o } / C S A$ should remain constant. However, a decrease in speciﬁc force of single skinned muscle ﬁbres has been observed in ageing (Larsson et al. 1997; D’Antona et al. 2003)and following disuse (Larsson et al. 1996; Widrick et al.1999; D’Antona et al. 2003). As regards young healthy subjects, no signiﬁcant change in Po/CSA has been observed following resistance training (Widrick et al.2002), and following a reduction in training volume (taper)inhighlytrainedswimmers(Trappeetal.2000).On the contrary, Po/CSA of single ﬁbres of male cross-country runners was reported to fall below control values during endurance training at the beginning of the competitive season and recovered to normal values with interval training late in the season (Harber et al. 2004).

The lower Po/CSA of type 1 ﬁbres of BB is unlikely to be due to a loss of myosin concentration in single ﬁbres as it has been observed in ageing and disuse (D’Antona et al. 2003). Whereas in the latter conditions the loss of myosin concentration occurred in the presence of signiﬁcant atrophy of muscle ﬁbres (D’Antona et al. 2003),type 1 ﬁbres of BB were not atrophic and surely not less used than type 1 ﬁbres of controls. Moreover, there is evidence that the rate of protein synthesis decreases in ageing (Balagopal et al. 1997) and disuse (Ferrando et al. 1996), whereas just the opposite phenomenon occurs during resistance training (Hasten et al. 2000).

Even less clear is the mechanism underlying the higher Po/CSA of fast ﬁbres in BB than in controls. An increase in myosin concentration able to explain a ∼40% increase in Po/CSA is difﬁcult to conceive as in young healthy subjects myoﬁbrils occupy most (∼95%) of the cytoplasm of single muscle ﬁbres and mitochondria occupy a small percentage of the intracellular space (Eisenberg, 1983). Whatever the underlying mechanisms, variations in Po/CSA in BB are particularly interesting for several reasons. They appear to parallel the degree of hypertrophy of muscle ﬁbres, i.e.the larger the hypertrophy the larger Po/CSA, and to be absent when hypertrophy does not occur as in slow ﬁbres.As they cannot be easily explained by a change in myosin concentration, they open the possibility that some still unknown mechanisms can modulate the force developed by a given amount of contractile material in skinned ﬁbres,i.e. in conditions of maximal activation and in the absence of a possible modulatory role of excitation–contraction coupling (Renganathan et al. 1997).

Slow ﬁbres of BB not only developed lower Po/CSA, but also shortened at lower $V _ { o }$ than slow ﬁbres of controls,whereas no difference in V o was observed in fast ﬁbres.A change in $V _ { o }$of a muscle ﬁbre type without a change in MHC isoform is unexpected on the basis of the MHC isoform-based control of V o (Bottinelli & Reggiani, 2000).However, exceptions were previously reported (Bottinelli,2001). It has been shown that $V _ { o }$ of single ﬁbres can decrease in ageing (Larsson et al. 1997; D’Antona et al.2003), and increase following disuse (Widrick et al. 1999;D’Antona et al. 2003). In young healthy subjects, an increasein$V _ { o }$wasreportedfollowingadecreaseintraining volume (taper) in highly trained swimmers (Trappe et al.2000), although in most training studies no change in V o was observed (Harridge et al. 1998; Widrick et al. 2002).

To clarify whether variations in $V _ { o }$ were due to a change in the properties of the myosin molecule itself,pure myosin 1 and 2A isoforms were extracted from single ﬁbres and studied in an in vitro motility assay (IVMA),a reconstituted contractile system in vitro in which the velocity of sliding of actin (V f) on isolated myosin can be determined. $V _ { f }$depends solely on the properties of the myosin molecule as sarcomere structure is lost and all other myoﬁbrillar proteins are missing. The observation that $V _ { f }$of myosin 1 of BB was lower than $V _ { f }$of myosin 1 of controls,whereasnodifferencewasobservedbetween$V _ { f } O f$ myosin 2A is consistent with the $V _ { o }$ﬁndings and suggests that the lower $V _ { o }$of type 1 ﬁbres of BB is due to a change in the properties of the myosin molecule itself. A change in the properties of the myosin molecule without a change in myosin isoform has been observed before in ageing (D’Antona et al. 2003). The mechanisms under lying such change are unknown. In most studies and in the present study, the possible role of MLC isoforms in modulating velocity has been considered and ruled out. Among other possible candidates, post-translational

modiﬁcations of myosin and the existence of yet unknown MHC isoforms appear the most likely.

## Anabolic steroids misuse

Although the analysis of the impact of anabolic steroids on skeletal muscle was beyond the goal of the present work, as anabolic steroid misuse was reported during pharmacological anamnesis by two BB and conﬁrmed by blood tests, the two populations of BB were compared.The larger hypertrophy is expected on the basis of the known effect of testosterone (Bhasin et al. 1996; Bhasin et al. 2001) and anabolic steroids misuse (Kadi et al. 1999;Hartgens et al. 2001) on muscle size. No difference in MHC distribution was found, consistent with previous observations in the rat suggesting that testosterone and nandrolone administration do not signiﬁcantly modify MHC distribution (Noirez & Ferry, 2000). Indeed, none of the phenomena observed were found to depend on anabolic steroid misuse itself, and the conclusions of the study appear safely related to muscle hypertrophy.

## Conclusions

Muscles of BB appear to be built to support the strong and powerful contractions performed during hypertrophic heavy resistance exercise. They show extreme hyper trophy (quantitative mechanism) and a bias towards the most powerful ﬁbre type (qualitative mechanism). Fast ﬁbres and especially the fastest 2X ﬁbres do not only show a very signiﬁcant (+76%) preferential hypertrophy,but they develop signiﬁcantly higher speciﬁc force than corresponding ﬁbre types of controls.

The mechanisms underlying such a characteristic phenotype are not fully understood. The extreme hyper trophy of vastus lateralis muscle could not be explained simplyonthebasisofmuscleﬁbrehypertrophyaswouldbe commonly expected. The selectively higher speciﬁc force of fast ﬁbres has never been observed before and cannot be readily explained on the basis of previous ﬁndings. The bias towards MHC-2X is not expected on the basis of the shift2X→2A generally observed in longitudinal studies on resistance training, and is consistent with previous observations on elite sprinters. Collectively the data not only conﬁrm the known mechanisms, but also suggest still undeﬁned mechanisms able to shape muscle phenotype.

## Appendix

In this appendix a simple model of muscle architecture is used to estimate whether the observed differences in mean ﬁbre area (MFA), which are an index of the differences in physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), in volume (V)and in anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSA) between

the vastus lateralis muscle (VL) of control subjects (CTRL)and body builders (BB) can be explained by a change in muscle architecture (pennation angle θ and ﬁbre length Lf) without any change in ﬁbre number. The ratio between ACSA and PCSA is known to change with pennation angle (θ) and ﬁbre length (Narici et al. 1996; Reeves et al. 2004).Moreover, θ is known to be higher in BB than in controls at least in the triceps muscle in which it has been measured (Kawakami et al. 1993).

It should be pointed out that the following calculations are not meant to provide exact values of the parameters,but mostly estimates to use for comparative purposes.

The experimental data that need to be ﬁtted are as follows.

$M F A _ { B B } = M F A _ { C T R L } \times 1 . 1 4$

ACSA vastus lateral$\sec t s _ { C T R L } = 2 1 c m ^ { 2 }$

ACSA vastus laterali$S _ { B B } = 3 2 c m ^ { 2 }$

$V _ { q d C T R L } = 1 5 4 0 c m ^ { 3 }$

$V _ { q d B B } = 2 0 9 3 c m ^ { 3 }$

Besides the above experimental data, two parameters used in the model are derived from the literature. As the volume of VL could not be precisely measured, as the edges of the VL were ill-deﬁned in some slices, it was estimated from the volume of the quadriceps on the basis of the relation $V _ { V L } = V _ { Q D } \times 0 .$.32 derived from Narici et al. (1992).Thus:

$V _ { V L C T R L } = 4 9 3 c m ^ { 3 }$

$V _ { V L B B } = 6 7 0 c m ^ { 3 }$

Thepennationangleofthevastuslateralisof young controls reported in a number of ﬁndings (Henriksson-Larsen et al. 1992; Narici et al. 1992;Fukunaga et al. 1997) was used:

θ=18deg

Finally, the linear model used is based on a widely accepted scheme of VL architecture previously described (Narici et al. 1992; Fukunaga et al. 1997; Aagaard et al.2001) (Fig. 8). The calculations assume a circular CSA of the muscle and use basic trigonometric equations.

We can ﬁrst of all calculate the diameter or thickness (t)of the VL of CTRL $( t _ { c } )$as:

$t _ { c } = ( \sqrt { ( } A C S A _ { C T R L } / \pi ) ) \times 2$

$= ( \sqrt { ( 2 1 c m ^ { 2 } / \pi ) ) \times 2 = 5 . 2 c m$

where π=3.14.

Using a pennation angle of 18 deg, the length of the ﬁbres of control subjects$( L _ { f , c } )$ and the projection (AB) of

Lf on the aponeurosis can be estimated:

$L _ { f , c } = t _ { c } / \sin$18=5.2cm/0.309=16.8cm

$A B = L _ { f , c } \times \cos 1 8 = 1 6 . 8 c m \times 0 . 9 5 1 = 1 6 . 0 c m$

We can now estimate the θ that is compatible with the ACSABB we determined by MRI. In such calculation we consider that the segment AB must have the same length in CTRL and BB, as the length of the muscle was very similar in the two subject populations and cannot change during muscle hypertrophy.

$t _ { B B } = ( \sqrt { ( } A C S A _ { B B } / \pi ) ) \times 2 = ( \sqrt { ( 3 3 } c m ^ { 2 } / \pi ) )$

×2=6.5cm

$T a n \theta = t _ { B B } / A B = 6 . 5 c m / 1 6 . 0 c m = 0 . 4 \theta = 2 1 . 8$deg

where tbb is the thickness of the VL of BB.

NowwecancalculatethelengthoftheﬁbresinBB$( L _ { f , B B } )$from tBB and θ:

$L _ { f , B B } = t _ { B B } / \sin \theta = 6 . 5 c m / \sin 2 1 . 8 = 1 7 . 5 c m$

Figure 8. A model of vastus lateralis architecture

The thick vertical lines represent the aponeurosis of the muscle; the thin parallel lines represents a sample of the muscle ﬁbres to show their pennation angle (θ) and length (Lf); t is the thickness of the muscle or distance between aponeurosis and is indicated by a dashed line; ACSA is anatomical cross-sectional area and is indicated by a dotted ellipse; the segment AB represents the projection of a ﬁbre on the aponeurosis and is an index of the length of the muscle.

So far we have estimated that an ACSA of 21 cm2 in CTRL and of 33 cm2 in BB is compatible with differences inpennationangleof3.8 deg(18 deginCTRLand21.8 deg in BB) and with a difference in Lf of 4.0% (Lf 16.8 cm in CTRL and 17.5 cm in BB). Such differences in θ and Lf seem compatible with the large values of θ observed in BB (Kawakami et al. 1993) and with the capacity of muscle ﬁbrestoincreaseinlength(bygainingsarcomeresinseries)following resistive training (Reeves et al. 2004).

We can now assess whether the calculated values of θand $L _ { f }$are consistent with an increase in PCSA of 1.14-fold as determined experimentally (see MFA).

PCSA of VL can be calculated knowing the volume of a muscle and the length of its ﬁbres$( P C S A = V / L _ { f } ) .$

$P C S A _ { C T R L } = 4 9 3 c m ^ { 3 } / 1 6 . 8 c m = 2 9 c m ^ { 2 }$

$P C S A _ { B B } = 6 7 0 c m ^ { 3 } / 1 7 . 5 c m = 3 8 c m ^ { 2 }$

$= P C S A _ { C T R L } \times 1 . 3$ (1)

Therefore, the estimated values for Lf and θ imply a $P C S A _ { B B }$ 1.3-fold larger than the PCSACTRL. The latter estimate is not consistent with MFA BB being merely 1.14-fold larger than MFACTRL.

$P C S A _ { C T R L } \times 1 .$ $L _ { f , b b }$ =

$P C S A _ { B B } = P C S A _ { C T R L } \times 1 . 1 4 = 2 9 c m ^ { 2 } \\ \times 1 . 1 4 = 3 3 c m ^ { 2 }$ $\times 1 . 1 4 = 3 3 c m ^ { 2 }$

$L f _ { . } B B = V _ { H _ { 1 } B B / P C S A _ { B B } = 6 7 0 c m ^ { 3 } / 3 3 c m ^ { 2 } = 2 0 . 3 c m$

Now we can determine which θ is compatible with such value of $L _ { t , b b }$ with no change in muscle length (i.e. keeping the length of segment AB constant).

$C o s \theta = A B / L _ { f . B B } = 1 6 . 0 c m / 2 0 . 3 c m = 0 . 8$

from whichθ=36.8deg

A θ of 38.0 deg in BB seems conceivable as it is in agreement with values reported for the triceps muscle by Kawakami et al. (1993). Now we can estimate the ACSA compatible withθ=36.8 deg and $L _ { f , b b } = 2 0 . 3 c m a n d$ see whether such estimated value is consistent with the experimental value.

$A C S A B B = ( ( L _ { f , B B } \times \sin \theta ) / 2 ) ^ { 2 } \times \pi$

$= ( ( 2 0 . 3 c m \times \sin 3 6 . 8 ) / 2 ) ^ { 2 } \times \pi = 1 1 6 c m ^ { 2 }$

The experimental values (33 cm2) is 3- to 4-fold smaller than the estimated value.

It appears therefore that changes in muscle architecture can only partly explain the large difference in volume (36%) and ACSA (55%) and the small difference in MFA between CTRL and BB (14%).

Theaboveconclusionscanbedemonstratedtobelargely independent from the values of θ (18 deg) and ratio between $V _ { Q D }$ and $V _ { V L }$ (0.32) taken from the literature.
